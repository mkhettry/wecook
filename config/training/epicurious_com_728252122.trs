IN	3 pounds octopus (preferably large tentacles only), thawed if frozen
IN	6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
IN	2 750-ml bottles dry red wine
IN	1 large onion, quartered
IN	3 garlic cloves, peeled, crushed

PR	Sprinkle octopus with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Add octopus to pot and cook uncovered until octopus releases its liquid and most of liquid in pot evaporates, turning occasionally with tongs, 20 to 25 minutes. Add wine, onion, garlic, cinnamon stick, and bay leaf to pot; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until octopus is very tender when pierced with fork, about 2 hours. Using tongs, transfer octopus to rimmed baking sheet and cool. If desired, rub off outer skin from octopus and discard. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
PR	Prepare barbecue (medium-high heat). Cut octopus tentacles crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place on platter and brush with 2 tablespoons oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Grill octopus slices until heated through, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to bowl and add remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, red wine vinegar, and oregano; toss to coat.
PR	Place Gigante beans in large shallow bowl. Top with octopus mixture and serve.
