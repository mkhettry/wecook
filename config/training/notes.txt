The sandwiches can also be made on a split baguette or rustic loaf such as ciabatta. After layering the ingredients in the loaf, cut into 4 individual sandwiches and serve.
Aïoli is a lovely fragrant and pungent type of mayonnaise  and the great thing is that you can take the flavour in any direction  try adding some pounded or chopped basil, fennel tops, dill or roasted nuts. Also great flavoured with lemon zest and juice. Its normally seasoned well and is used to enhance things like fish stew in order to give them a real kick. You might wonder why I suggest using 2 types of olive oil to make this. By blending a strong peppery one with a mellower one you achieve a lovely rounded flavour.
Try this: Lemon- or basil-flavoured aïoli are good with salads, all types of fish, and in seafood soups. Also great with roasted fish, chicken or pork, and classic with salmon.
The less vermouth in it, the drier the martini.
For those of you who pay attention, yes, we did talk about this back in August . I just feel like minds weren't sufficiently blown that time around. Certainly, mine wasn't, so I thought I'd share my feelings on the matter.
Me: "I'm going to need crème fraîche for the dinner I'm cooking tomorrow. But dangit if my local supermarket only carries heavy cream and buttermilk!"
Buddy: "You know you can just mix heavy cream and buttermilk, let it sit overnight, and you've got crème fraîche, right?"
Me: "Auauhungh?" Mind = blown.
OK, that conversation didn't really happen, but the first time I mixed buttermilk and heavy cream and let it sit overnight until it became thick and creamy, my mind was honestly more blown than it had been since finding out that Brad Pitt and Edward Norton share a body .
And here I thought making ricotta was easy!
I played around with the ratios of cream to buttermilk quite a bit and in the end found that it doesn't really matter all that much. Add more buttermilk and you'll need less time for it to thicken (but it'll be less creamy). Add more, and it takes longer, but tastes better. One tablespoon per cup (that's a 1:16 ratio) was about the perfect balance for me.
It gets super rich and creamy at right about the 12-hour mark. You can also halt the process early by just refrigerating it to stop the bacterial action. This is useful if you want a thinner Mexican-style crema agria for drizzling over tacos or sopes . For those of you worried about cream spoiling at room temp, that's the idea: it's the good bacteria from the buttermilk multiplying in there that prevents the dangerous bacteria from taking over.
And let the mind-blowing begin. Commence countdown.
For me, the best part of a fish is its skin.  Much like the treasured outside of a roast chicken, the skin is crisp, salty, and deeply flavorful —that is, when it's cooked properly.  I never understand the virtue of a fillet of fish without the skin and always try to buy a whole fish with it still on whenever possible.  Not only is it cheaper, but you get all kinds of textures and anything cooked whole and on the bone with cartilage and connective tissue will be moister and more delicious.
I turned to Mario Batali for this recipe from his book Molto Mario .  He calls for a whole large snapper to feed four, which is the recipe I'm repeating here, but I cooked mine with a small branino for two.  Either way, the sauce is marvelous: black olives, capers, white, and lemon zest are spooned into the skillet after the fish gets a thorough searing over high heat. In the oven, it practically melts with the pan juices. Parsley, flaky salt, and a drizzle of olive oil on top and it's ready.
I'll admit that I was a little bit slow jumping on the flax seed bandwagon. Maybe it was an anti-hype reaction. Everyone was saying how good they are for you, and I instinctively recoiled. Because if all that's being said it how healthy they are, then flavor must not be a selling point.
Besides, I had plenty of other favorite seeds to dump into bread. I adore sesame seeds, caraway belongs in rye, and of course poppy seeds are a must on Chicago-style hot dog buns.
But while I can easily resist hype, I have a hard time resisting a great sale, so when I saw a bag of ground flax seeds at a bargain price, I figured that I had nothing to lose. And then I saw whole flax seeds at the bulk food store and I figured that a little bag wouldn't break the bank.
Before I baked with them, I sampled the whole light flax seeds and I was surprised to find they actually tasted good. I was expecting them to be tasteless at best, but instead they tasted sort of a like a cross between sunflower seeds and sesame seeds . Oh yes, I could do something with these. And I could feel virtuous at the same time because flax is good for...something.

Pairing Suggestion When pairing wine with meat, always consider the flavors that are in the sauce. A Tuscan Sangiovese has the earthiness, dried-fruit notes and juiciness to go with this pan sauce.
It seems as though every restaurant in America offers a version of this amazing cake created by master chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten . But his supremely rich and chocolaty original is in a class by itself.
See our wine pairings below
Pairing Suggestion Chocolate is too intense and bitter for many sweet wines, but not port. Try this dessert with a Ruby Porto.
Make Ahead The batter can be refrigerated for several hours; bring to room temperature before baking.
This supersilky chocolate custard appears regularly on the dessert menu at Rubicon in San Francisco. Nicole Krasinski suggests serving it slightly chilled.
When I was a newbie, someone in the cookbook biz once told me that if a cookbook has one great recipe in it, it’s totally worth it. And I agree with that. I have a mountain of cookbooks, and most have plenty of tempting recipes but I’ve only made one thing from many of them. But those that do make the cut become standards—or what we call “ go to ” recipes.
One such cookbook was the Joy of Cooking , which was re-published with great fanfare (and some undeserved derision) in 1997. I remember a blurb on the book jacket from a previous edition, by a bride who swore she toted the book along when she moved abroad. Which I didn’t, although I was hardly a blushing bride. So at least I have an excuse.
My “go to” recipe from that book was the Feta Dressing . I think it was promoted as ‘healthy’, which certainly has some appeal. But what I liked most about it was that it had lots and lots of feta in it, one of my very favorite cheeses, and one of the most versatile. Feta is the cheese I go to when I want to crumble something over hot pasta, since the strong flavor holds up really well and as it warms up, the cheese turns into soft, salty cubes that play off whole wheat pasta particularly well. I like the pasta with stewed greens, garlic, and a heavy hand of chopped olives tossed in. Or even crumbled over pasta with pesto . Try it!
I’m also a big, big fan of winter greens, like frisée, Belgian endive, and escarole. And this dressing is thick enough to stand up to those tougher, slightly-bitter salads that I crave when the temperature drops.
I didn’t jot down this recipe when I did my transatlantic split, but it was pretty easy to re-create. The original had oregano in it, but I used thyme , since oregano and marjoram aren’t easily found, but fresh thyme always is.
(Maybe it’s all going into that marjoram-flavored diet water ?)
The dressing includes a good dose of red wine vinegar, but resist the temptation to use another one: the abrupt acidity of red wine vinegar gives the dressing its kick.
Inspired by the Joy of Cooking
Feta is now protected and must be from Greece, and is made from sheep or goat’s milk. I pluck my feta out of the watery bins in Arab markets in France, and sometimes buy the real-deal or I choose a milder, similarly-crumbly, salted cheese, depending on what strikes my fancy at the moment. Other varieties, which can no longer be called feta , are made elsewhere and you can use what’s available.
I’ve made this dressing with dried oregano, too. If using dried, use half the amount called for. Be generous with the dressing when tossing the salad. I leave it chunky, because I like the texture (and it’s one less thing to wash), but it can also be pureed in a blender or food processor.
Thank you for all the kind words and encouragement. You guys rock!
The I'm-not-in-the-mood-to-blog/cook moment happens to everyone, it seems like. At the end, we all go back to where we belong and are happy - cooking/baking. During the break, I dined out, traveled, read more books, and checked out inspiring blogs. All these things gave me motivation and energy.  My appetite is back, at least for now.
I hope everyone had a great Chinese New Year and super bowl.  I was happily full; that's all I can say!
I finally got around to this inked spaghetti I bought in Italy last October. Yeah..I know...I just got my hands on it now. The color makes a dramatic presentation and adds a wow factor to the finish. It's really easy, light, and elegant. This is my first time working on live mussels. Keith doesn't like them that much so I don't get a chance too often. However, for this type of spaghetti, it couldn't be better than with seafood. Keith doesn't like squid and scallops so he left me only a few options - shrimp and fish. I work for a shrimp importing company so they don't excite me that much. I decided to go with mussels and fish.
Please feel free to add any kind of seafood you like.
PS: I got really busy at work but I will catch up with my favorite blogs very soon!
Where did my motivation go?
Hmm...not sure how to answer that.
Recently, I've been a slacker with cooking and other things. I've been too lazy to cook. Is that really bad? I'm not bored of cooking but I'm just not in the mood. I also have a few things (unrelated to cooking) that I have to figure out and think about but the laziness pushes me away from doing that too. Have you ever felt like doing nothing? Where did my motivation to do things go?
It took me more effort just to make the marinade for the fish last night. Why didn't I do it the next day or the day after that, you ask? Well, I was "planing" to cook miso salmon on Monday so I bought fish from the market on Monday. However, I procrastinated on the task until Tuesday.  If I didn't do it last night the fish would go bad. So, I did. At least it's a good start right?
Sigh.
Thanks for all the comments from the last post - The best pizza dough! As you know Denise 's secret is bread obsession . She left me a comment with interesting information and I'd like to share. Denise said cold rise dough has a special flavor compared to normal rise dough.. If Denise who is an expert on making bread said so, the dough recipe is worth bookmarking! This information is new to me and I'm glad to know. Thanks Denise!
I apologize if this pumpkin sauce is too late past Fall.  I'm not going to lie, this dish was made a few months back and hasn't gotten a chance to shine on this blog. I also made penne with the same pumpkin sauce for the New Year's Eve party I hosted. I used fresh homemade pumpkin puree. If you don't have it or are lazy, don't worry at all. Canned pure pumpkin puree works just fine.
Fingers are crossed that my motivation will come back soon (muah!)
You will have some crispy pork belly left over. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
I'm officially 30.
Gosh. I'm old.
(I know some of you would yell at me to shut up - 30 isn't old!) 
There are many things come to my life. Come and go. Good and bad. New and old. I don't take things for granted but feel fortunate to meet great people.
When I was young, 30 is old. I now am 30, and I don't feel any difference from being on late twenties yet. My friends said you will at some point.  Kids come to a marriage life equation. I know it's joy and blessing to have kids. However, I don't know if I want them yet. I just feel I should. New ideas of doing and trying things still keep popping in my head. I have to tell myself to stop and think; do it one at a time.
This past few weeks have been very busy for me. We have a new employee at work that I need to train. My boss was in town, technical Problem at my blog. All committed occasions that we have to attend, birthdays (there are so many Scorpios!), traveling, and the new gig. They keep me very busy. I feel like I need a break. A glass of wine before bedtime completes my day. Since the Europe trip, I've realized a glass of wine a day isn't bad and it helps me sleep well! It may help me build up an alcohol tolerance and I won't be a "Red Lobster" at a social function again. With all that said, the lucky part is that I don't have gray hairs yet! Yippee. Hahaha.
I apologize for not being around a blogosphere much. It has been hectic for me recently and I've been so bad at getting back to people.
So, this dish I made a little while back. I didn't write a measurement down so I didn't remember how much I put but it's pretty easy that you don't need a recipe for this. You get the idea of the dish and you will get it. I'm sorry if this post sounds lousy but I don't want to give you wrong measurements!
Before anything else, I'd like to shout out some news
These greens turn out just a little spicy, a kick even the little ones love
This salad hits you full on with its sharp sweetness and oniony heat, and it's just what I'd prescribe to shake up tired tastebuds a bit on a drowsy wintry night. Serve it alongside a seasonal stew – squash, say – and you'll get a perfect balance. If you fancy serving it on its own as a light starter, add a handful of chopped walnuts and a few baby leaves.
If you are not put off by peeling lots of shallots and garlic cloves, you're in for a winter treat with this hearty, oniony mushroom stew topped with ricotta. You don't need much more, though a chunk of sourdough would not go amiss. To help with the peeling, soak the shallots and garlic in water for half an hour
Don’t you hate it when you underestimate how much cake batter you will have with a mixture and end up using a mixing bowl which is far, far too small for it. And then you end up battling waves of cake batter with your hands and a spatula, while simultaneously trying to hold the bowl still and getting batter all over your arms. AND THEN, a single strand of hair decides to start poking you in the eyeball and you’d attempt to blow it off your face and you think that it’d be so much easier if you could just brush it off using a hand but then that would mean that you end up with cake batter on your face and in your hair. And during all this, you’re berating yourself for not using a bigger mixing bowl but if you pull one out now then that will mean you have yet another dish to wash AS WELL AS ADMITTING DEFEAT TO THE CAKE.
*takes a deep breath*
Sure, the above may not have happened to you (probably because you, my darling readers, are not quite as abysmally stubborn or insane as I am), but you can put yourself in my shoes and be aware of the mindset that I was in when my sister, at that VERY moment when my baking world was drowing in sticky brown sugar cake batter, decided to waltz up to me and ask what I was making.
“Sour cream & rhubarb cake” was my grumbled response.
“Ewwww”, she replied. “I hate rhubarb”
SRFGOHN:RGJK:RH?IOJK!)*&RT)({&$(!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN, YOU HATE RHUBARB?!”
Okay, so I didn’t mean to holler that bit, and felt a bit bad when she cowered slightly from the manic tone in my voice, but still – come on! Who hates rhubarb? How can you hate rhubarb?
Well, I might understand a dislike of rhubarb if someone at some stage convinced you to gnaw on a raw stalk, but when properly cooked, it’s one of those divine foodstuffs which can help create a wonderful sour balance to sweetness, akin the the powers of the almighty lemon.
*takes a moment to bow to the lemon gods*
After some Kitchen Wench-style interrogation , I discovered that my sister didn’t actually hate rhubarb, but that she had never actually eaten it before. Which actually brings me to a pet peeve of mine – saying you hate a food because you’ve never had it before. When it comes to something such as crumbed and deep fried sheeps brains , I can understand being a little hesitant, but rhubarb is a classic dessert foodstuff which can be so incredibly tasty when treated with the respect that it deserves!
As this was the case, I coerced my sister into enjoying a slice of the cake once it was out of the oven, with a big decadent dollop of double cream and this was enough to change her tune from “I hate rhubarb” to “Oh-my-god-this-rhubarb-cake-is-freakin-DELICIOUS!”
I can’t take any credit for the cake itself since the recipe comes from Australia’s own baking goddess, Belinda Jeffery, but what I can do is vouch for it’s fabulousness. The cake can be served almost like a pudding when taken straight out of the oven, or you can let it cool and firm up a bit, at which point it becomes this unctuous, incredibly moist and tender structure, with delightful chunks of rhubarb to balance the richness and sweetness of the cake itself.
It’s rather homely in appearance, but while I wouldn’t use this for a wedding cake, it’s the perfect sort of morsel that you’d enjoy around the kitchen table with a cup of tea, a little dollop of cream on the side and while enjoying a quiet, peaceful afternoon
Sour Cream & Rhubarb Cake
(recipe from “The Country Cookbook” by Belinda Jeffery)
Here's something I don't think I've ever mentioned. And it may sound a bit strange. We have heat here in our apartment, we might even have air-conditioning. Never used either. I think what may have happened is this. We didn't use heat the first year we lived here, not sure why exactly - warm year? Beyond that, every time I thought about turning on the heat, I would consider the dust and god-knows-what-else accumulating in the vents and ducts. I would promptly put on a third sweater instead of reaching for the dial. The office has a fireplace, so I sit near that quite a bit. But the kitchen gets quite cold. So, when the weather cools off, I tend to bake. The oven keeps the kitchen cozy, and now and then I stand in front of it, crack the door, and let the hot air flow up under my sweater to warm me up. I baked this farro "risotto" last night instead of cooking it stove top, and it worked out nicely - lemon-kissed, bright tomato sauce, lots of Parmesan, and chopped fresh oregano. I use the term risotto loosely here :)
So, here's what you do. Start the grains on the stove top, add all the liquid at once, cover, and transfer to the oven for the better part of an hour. If you have a medium/large oven-proof casserole, like a Le Creuset, you can go start to finish in the same pot/casserole. Although, I can't remember if the knobs on the lids of Le Creuset can handle a 400F oven? It may be too hot - you may still need to use foil to cover the pot.
Calling this a risotto is a bit of a stretch, it's not particularly creamy or loose. It won't run across a plate. But when I make it on a stove top, I use a risotto technique, so that's sort of how I think of it. If you think you might like a more oozy, cheesy version, use small cubes of good mozzarella in place of the Parmesan in the recipe below, or experiment with a blend. I mean, it's cheese - you can make it as cheesy or un-cheesy as you like. I was after something with cheese, but not over-the-top decadent here.
Baked Farro Risotto Recipe You can bake this in an oven-proof casserole. As far as grains go, I used semi-pearled farro, but I can imagine making this with semi-pearled barley as well. Beyond that, arborio rice would be an logical and easy-to-find alternative. Different grains will likely affect the consistency of the risotto in the end, some might end up drier or more fluid, but you can adjust the baking time accordingly, and I don't think you'll be too far off using this amount of broth/water.
