OT	I was pleasantly surprised to find that this came out just as good as the fried rice I get at my favorite local Thai restaurant. I followed the recipe in terms of ingredients, but here are a few extra things I did: I pounded my chicken breasts flat, cut them up into strips, and quickly stir fried them in a little olive oil and just a pinch of salt. Once they were almost cooked through, I splashed on a little bit of soy sauce and set them aside. I cooked my sliced onions in the butter, (instead of the eggs. I used PAM for those) Great flavor and gave the rice a little something too. When I combined all ingredients, I also added some green onion to this dish, red pepper, and red pepper flakes. Also! *Make sure your rice is cold when you cook this!* GREAT recipe, will use again and again. Thanks! Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	Excellent, easy recipe. I rinse the rice in cold water, so I don't have to wait. I also decreased the pepper because it's got a little too much zip. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	Love this one! I used thawed frozen mixed vegis and added them after everything. Made for a very quick and easy recipe. I do recommend that you have everything chopped and ready to add before you actually start cooking as this cooks very quickly and leaves no time in between. My 3yo loves fried rice when we are out so this was an excellent dinner for her! And I could chop the vegis and chicken into bite sizes for her and not worry about her trying to stuff something too big into her mouth! And the rest of the family loves it just as well, even my super picky husband (who seems to never eat anythign I make! LOL) Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	This is one of those recipes you can easily tweek to your own tastes. I added peas and green onions at the end with the egg. Only used 1/2 of the pepper called for & used seasme oil instead of the veg. oil. Thought it made a very good side. Will make again! Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	This needed some alteration, but turned out great. And bear in mind it's a lot of work and requires significant chopping. I added green onion and chopped ed pepper, as well as teriyaki sauce. I also added some red pepper flakes for spice. And at the last minute, I added some pineapple and pineapple juice and cashews for a special treat. My boyfriend loved it! It made a lot.

OT	This was a very tasty and simple recipe. I added some chopped up garlic to the onions as I sauteed them. Also I recommend using A LOT less pepper as it is VERY spicy if you don't. You really don't have to put any pepper in if you don't want to. It's quite flavorful without it. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	This is a simple, quick fried rice recipe that the whole family liked. I omitted the chicken, and added shrimp and frozen peas. Used it as a side dish to sweet and sour chicken. I will definitely use this one again! Was this review helpful? [ YES ]
