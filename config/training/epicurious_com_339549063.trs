IN	1 1/2 cups red wine of any variety
IN	1/2 cup sugar
IN	1 vanilla bean, split (not scraped)
IN	2 whole star anise
IN	1 teaspoon pink peppercorns
PR	Combine the wine, sugar, vanilla bean, star anise, and peppercorns in a wide pot or skillet over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Bring to a boil, then decrease the heat to medium; cook until the liquid becomes syrupy and has reduced by about two-thirds, about 10 minutes.
PR	Use a fine-mesh strainer to strain the syrup into a small container; discard the spices and let cool. Use immediately or cover and refrigerate.
NO	Variation: Use white wine instead of red, and use 1 vanilla bean and five or six 1/4-inch slices of fresh ginger.
