IN	1 1/2 cups whole grain quick-cooking bulgur (such as BobÂ’s Red Mill)
IN	2 1/4 cups chopped green onions (about 14 onions)
IN	2 cups chopped plum tomatoes (about 14 ounces)
IN	3/4 cup chopped fresh dill
IN	3/4 cup chopped fresh mint
IN	1/2 cup olive oil
IN	1 tablespoon plus 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
IN	1 teaspoon ground cumin
IN	55 (or more) brined grape leaves from two 7-to 8-ounce jars, drained, stems cut off if needed
IN	1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
IN	Fresh dill sprigs (for garnish)
IN	Fresh mint sprigs (for garnish)
IN	Ingredient info: Bulgur is available at some supermarkets and at natural foods stores. Brined grape leaves are sold at some supermarkets, and at specialty foods stores and Greek markets.
IN	Test-kitchen tip: Weighing the grape leaves down prevents them from opening up while they simmer.
PR	Combine bulgur, green onions, tomatoes, chopped dill, chopped mint, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, cumin, 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper in large bowl; toss. Let soak at room temperature at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
PR	Line bottom of large pot with 2 layers of grape leaves, covering bottom completely; set aside.
PR	Open 1 grape leaf and lay flat, veined side down, on work surface (if leaf is small or broken, patch with 1 additional grape leaf). Place 1 tablespoon bulgur filling atop center of leaf. Fold stem end of leaf up over bulgur filling, then fold in sides of leaf over filling and roll up leaf tightly, enclosing filling completely. Place on baking sheet. Repeat with remaining grape leaves and bulgur filling.
PR	Place filled grape leaves, seam side down, in bottom of grape-leaf-lined pot, fitting snugly together and layering filled leaves atop one another as needed. Pour enough water over filled grape leaves to cover generously (about 6 cups), then pour 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil over. Place tart pan bottom atop leaves in pot; top with heavy heatproof dish or plate to weigh down. Bring liquid to simmer. Cover pot and reduce heat to very low; continue to simmer until bulgur filling is tender, 45 to 55 minutes.
PR	Remove from heat and allow grape leaves to cool in liquid to room temperature. Gently remove filled grape leaves from liquid and place on platter. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Cover and chill.
PR	Garnish platter with dill sprigs and mint sprigs and serve.
