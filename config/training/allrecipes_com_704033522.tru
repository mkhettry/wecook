OT	Hearty Creole Okra and Tomatoes
OT	"A great Southern okra dish that allegedly comes from the heart of Acadiana. This vegetable dish is heavy enough to serve as a main dish and makes one pine for the fiddles and chicory coffee."

OT	Original Recipe Yield 12 servings
OT	Ingredients
OT	2 tablespoons butter
OT	2 tablespoons olive oil
OT	4 stalks celery, chopped
OT	2 onions, chopped
OT	4 ears fresh corn, shucked and kernels scraped from cob
OT	2 pounds fresh okra, cut into 1/2 inch slices
OT	2 (28 ounce) cans whole tomatoes, broken up
OT	1/2 pound andouille sausage, diced
OT	1/2 teaspoon Creole seasoning, or to taste
OT	sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
OT	Directions
OT	Heat butter and olive oil over medium heat in a large pot. Cook and stir celery and onions until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the corn kernels and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in okra, tomatoes, andouille sausage, and Creole seasoning; cover and cook over medium heat until the okra has lost all of its slippery texture, at least 45 minutes. Season with sea salt, black pepper, and more Creole seasoning if necessary. Cook, uncovered, to reduce liquid, about 10 minutes.

OT	I left out the sausage (because I didn't have any) and it came out very good. I can tell the sausage would make it perfect. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	A version of this has long been a family favorite. If you don't have the sausage, brown 1/2 to 1 lb of ground beef and add it along with 1-2 cups of cooked elbow macaroni. It will become an entire dish even without the meat. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	Simply SPECTACULAR!! I made it by the recipe to a T only adding a jalapeno because I like them and had some on hand. Will add some chicken next time. I seasoned with CREOLE SEASONING BLEND by Joslyn from this site. This is a well-balanced and delicious combination and a great one-dish meal. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	Yumm A++ This is a great recipe to use up those garden veggies! I cut the recipe in half because there's only 2 of us. I added a couple of jalepenos and 1/2 of water plus all listed ingredients in a crockpot and let it simmer for a few hours. Thank you wasabinoir! PS: make some cornbread to go along with it!!
