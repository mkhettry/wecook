IN	Butter-flavored nonstick cooking spray
IN	1/2 cup chopped canned beets, drained
IN	7 ounces (about 1 cup) canned red beans, drained and rinsed
IN	1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
IN	3/4 cup liquid egg substitute
IN	3 tablespoons whole wheat pastry flour
IN	3/4 cup agave nectar
IN	1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
IN	1 teaspoon vanilla extract
IN	1/2 teaspoon almond extract
IN	2 teaspoons natural red food coloring
PR	1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Spray an 8 x 8 x 2-inch baking dish with cooking spray.
PR	2. Combine the beets, beans, cocoa powder, egg substitute, and flour in the bowl of a food processor. Process until the mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl halfway through.
PR	3. Add the agave, butter, vanilla, almond extract, and food coloring. Process until all of the ingredients are combined, about 1 minute.
PR	4. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish, and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 28-30 minutes, turning the dish halfway through the baking time. A toothpick inserted in the center will come out with soft batter clinging to it.
PR	5. Let the brownies cool completely in the baking dish on a wire rack. Then put them in the fridge for at least 3 hours. When they're cold, cut them into 12 squares and serve. Refrigerate any leftovers.
