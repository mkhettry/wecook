Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss crumbs with 2 teaspoons mustard, 2 teaspoons oil, and mustard seeds in medium bowl to coat.
Scatter on rimmed baking sheet. Bake until golden and crisp, 6 to 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, add enough water to deep large nonstick skillet to cover bottom. Add spinach; toss over high heat to wilt, about 2 minutes. Scrape into sieve set over bowl; press out liquid. Wipe out skillet; reserve.
Transfer spinach to medium saucepan. Add 3 teaspoons mustard, half and half, and chopped thyme. Stir over medium heat until thick, about 3 minutes. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Remove from heat.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in reserved skillet over medium-high heat. Crack eggs into skillet, spacing apart. Fry until whites are cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Divide spinach between 2 plates, spreading out as base for eggs. Top with eggs, crumbs, and thyme sprigs.
Assemble the sandwiches
Preheat a heavy fry pan or grill pan over medium-high heat. Spread the bottom of each roll with mustard. Layer the pork, ham, cheese and pickles on the rolls, dividing evenly. Set the top halves in place and press gently. Brush the tops of the rolls with the melted butter.
Grill the sandwiches
Place the sandwiches in the heated pan and weight with a second pan or a weighted press. Grill until the undersides are golden, about 2 1/2 minutes. Turn the sandwiches over, weight again, and cook until the other sides are golden and the cheese is melted, about 2 1/2 minutes more. Serve immediately. Serves 4.
Heat a griddle pan until it's really smoking hot, then griddle each slice of ciabatta for a couple of minutes on each side until they are nicely charred.
Cut the garlic clove in half, rub each ciabatta slice with garlic and drizzle with a little olive oil. Tear the mozzarella evenly over the 8 crostini. Season well with salt and pepper, sprinkle over the sliced chilli and basil leaves and grate over the lemon zest. Finish with another drizzle of olive oil.
1 Very finely grate the apples and dress with the lemon juice before mixing in the horseradish and seasoning to taste with salt and pepper.
Smash up the garlic with 1 teaspoon of salt in a pestle and mortar (or use the end of a rolling pin in a metal bowl). Place the egg yolk and mustard in a bowl and whisk together, then start to add your olive oils bit by bit. Once youve blended in a quarter of the oil you can start to add the rest in larger amounts. When its all gone in, add the garlic and lemon juice and any extra flavours (see above). To finish it off, season to taste with salt, pepper and a bit more lemon juice if needed.
Knock up this tasty cocktail while youre cooking dinner: Whiz the berries and vodka in a blender with a splash of cold water and the lime juice. Once well mixed, divide between 2 glasses and enjoy.
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together into a bowl. Beat butter and sugar with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla. Reduce speed to low. With machine running, gradually add flour mixture; mix until combined. Shape into a disk, and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until firm, at least 45 minutes (or up to 3 days).
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Roll to 1/8 inch thick. Using a 5-inch-tall bunny-shaped cookie cutter, cut out cookies. Space 2 inches apart on parchment-lined baking sheets. Reroll scraps, and cut out. Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.
Bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool completely on sheets on wire racks. Cookies can be stored in airtight containers at room temperature up to 1 week.
Set a large pot of salted water to boil. Place flour in a shallow dish, and season with salt and pepper. Dredge cutlets, shaking off excess. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high. Cook chicken in batches, adding remaining oil as needed, until light golden, 1 to 3 minutes per side; transfer to a dish.
Add broth to skillet, and bring to a boil; cook until reduced by half. Add artichokes, capers, and the chicken with any juices. Gently swirl to combine, and bring just to a boil. Remove skillet from heat. Swirl in butter, and cover to keep warm.
Add pasta to boiling water. Cook until al dente; drain. Serve chicken and sauce over pasta, topped with parsley.
Fill a large saucepan with about 4 inches of water, add vinegar, and bring to a boil. Fill a shallow dish or pie plate with warm water. Reduce heat under saucepan to medium, so water is just barely simmering. Break 1 egg at a time into a small heat-proof bowl. Gently tip bowl into water; carefully slide egg into water. Repeat with remaining eggs.
When eggs begin to become opaque, remove them from the saucepan with a slotted spoon in the order in which they were added. Transfer the eggs to the dish of warm water. This process should take about 3 minutes.
Prepare the hollandaise sauce, and set aside, keeping it warm.
Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add Canadian bacon, and cook until well browned on both sides. Divide bacon among the English-muffin halves. For each serving, use a slotted spoon to remove one egg from warm water; set spoon and egg briefly on a clean cloth or paper towel to drain. Gently place the egg on a bacon-topped muffin, and spoon the reserved warm hollandaise sauce over the top.
Put salt, sugar, onions, leeks, carrots, celery, bay leaves, thyme, parsley, peppercorns, and 10 cups water in a large stockpot. Bring to a boil, stirring until salt and sugar have dissolved. Remove from heat; let brine cool completely.
Add turkey, breast first, to the brine. Cover; refrigerate 24 hours. Remove from brine; pat dry with paper towels. Let stand at room temperature 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees, with rack in lowest position. Stir together melted butter and wine in a medium bowl. Fold a very large piece of cheesecloth into quarters so that it is large enough to cover breast and halfway down sides of turkey. Immerse cloth in butter mixture; let soak.
Place turkey, breast side up, on a rack set in a roasting pan. Fold wing tips under turkey. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper inside turkey. Loosely fill body and neck cavities with stuffing. Tie legs together with kitchen twine. Fold neck flap under; secure with toothpicks. Rub turkey all over with softened butter; season with salt and pepper.
Remove cheesecloth from butter mixture, squeezing gently into bowl. Reserve butter mixture for brushing. Lay cheesecloth over turkey. Place turkey, legs first, in oven. Roast 30 minutes. Brush cheesecloth and exposed turkey with butter mixture. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees. Roast, brushing every 30 minutes, 2 1/2 hours more; cover with foil if browning too quickly. If making gravy, add giblets and neck to pan 1 1/2 hours after reducing temperature; roast 30 minutes, and reserve.
Push pears and ginger through juice extractor. Working in batches, push carrots, celery, beet, and parsley through juice extractor. Stir in lemon juice. Divide between two 8-ounce glasses and serve.scard cheesecloth; rotate pan. Baste turkey with pan juices. Roast, rotating pan halfway through, until skin is golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 180 degrees and stuffing reaches 165 degrees, about 1 hour. Transfer to a platter. Set pan with drippings aside for gravy. Let turkey stand at room temperature at least 30 minutes. Garnish, if desired.
In a cocktail shaker half full of ice cubes, combine gin or vodka and vermouth. Shake well, and strain into martini glasses. Garnish with olives, and serve.
Combine buttermilk and heavy cream in non-reactive container. Cover and allow to rest at room temperature until thickened to desired texture, about 12 hours. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
Preheat oven to 450 degreed Fahrenheit.  Dredge fish in flour on both sides and shake off excess.  Heat olive oil in a heavy, oven-proof skillet large enough to hold the fish over medium-high heat until just smoking.  Lay fish carefully in the pan and cook without touching until golden brown.
Turn fish over carefully and add olives, capers, lemon zest and segments, juice from remaining lemons, and wine.
Transfer skillet to oven. Roast fish until fish is just cooked through, 10-15 minutes depending on thickness.  Remove from oven and allow to rest at least 5 minutes.
Serve whole fish tableside or fillet onto plates.  Top with parsley, flaky salt, and a drizzle of olive oil.  Serve immediately.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Spread  beets, kale, and garlic on rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, and toss to combine. Roast until the beets are soft and the kale is tender, 20-30 minutes.
Meanwhile, cover farro with cold water in  medium saucepan, season with salt, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain excess water, then add roasted vegetables and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and lemon juice and divide amongst bowls. Crumble goat cheese and serve hot or warm.
Combine the water, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of your stand mixer and set aside until it's foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the rye flour, flax meal and about half of the bread flour. Stir to combine, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside for 20 minutes.
Knead with the dough hook until the gluten begins developing, about 5 minutes. Then add the remaining bread flour, salt, and yogurt. Knead with the dough hook until the mixture is elastic. Add the seeds and oil and continue kneading until the oil is incorporated and the seeds are well distributed in the dough. Form the dough into a ball and drizzle with a bit of olive oil to coat. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside until doubled, about 1 hour.
Flour your work surface and preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Sprinkle some cornmeal on a baking sheet. Remove the dough from the bowl and form it into your preferred shape. Place it on the prepared baking sheet, seam-side down, and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside until it has doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
Remove the plastic wrap, slash the loaf as desired, and bake at 350 degrees until nicely browned, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely on a rack before slicing.
When choosing Anjum Anand 's Anjum's New Indian for this week's Cook the Book, I had my heart set on her wonderful winter curries.  Rich and saucy, they warm you through their heat with all those layers of spices. This Maharashtran Lamb Curry was exactly what I was hoping for.
This really lamby curry is a sweet-savory-sour mix of coconut, caramelized onions, tamarind, and a blend of spices known as Black Masala .  Sometimes referred to as Goda Masala , it combines a laundry list of spices as well as ground, toasted coconut and sesame seeds.  The sweetness of the coconut and the sour tamarind paste make a gorgeous, rich sauce to coat the lamb chunks.
While the recipe calls for lamb neck filet, a cut that can be cooked quickly, I chose to go with lamb stew meat.  The stew meat required additional cooking time, about an hour of simmering, and cooked down in the sauce to fork-tender deliciousness.
As always with our Cook the Book feature, we have five (5) copies of Anjum's New Inidan to give away this week.

Using a blender, make a smooth paste of the ginger and garlic with a little water.
Heat the oil in a nonstick saucepan, add the onion and cook until golden. Remove half and reserve. Add the poppy seeds and unsweetened dried coconut flakes to the pan and continue cooking until golden. Scrape into a blender and blend to a fine paste, adding a little water to help, then set aside.
Spoon the reserved onions back into the pan, reheat and add the ginger and garlic paste. Cook until golden brown, around 2–3 minutes. Add the lamb and brown evenly, stirring often, around 4 minutes. Stir in the salt and spices and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
Add the coconut milk, tamarind paste and the onion and poppy seed paste along with a good splash of water. Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for 5 minutes. The gravy should be creamy, not too thick or thin. Taste and adjust the seasoning, stir in the cilantro and serve.
Preheat the oven to 400°. In a medium skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Season the lamb with salt and pepper. Add the lamb to the skillet, fat side down, and cook over moderately high heat until richly browned, about 3 minutes. Turn the lamb fat side up and cook for 2 minutes longer. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the rack for about 20 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the meat registers 125° for medium-rare. Transfer the lamb to a carving board and let rest for 10 minutes.
Discard the fat in the skillet. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil and the shallots to the skillet and cook over moderate heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the wine and simmer until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add the stock and bring to a simmer. Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the whole grain and Dijon mustards and the thyme. Season the sauce with salt and pepper.
Carve the lamb into chops and arrange on warmed plates. Spoon the sauce over the lamb and serve.
Preheat the oven to 450°. Butter and lightly flour four 6-ounce ramekins. Tap out the excess flour. Set the ramekins on a baking sheet.
In a double boiler, over simmering water, melt the butter with the chocolate. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the egg yolks, sugar and salt at high speed until thickened and pale.
Whisk the chocolate until smooth. Quickly fold it into the egg mixture along with the flour. Spoon the batter into the prepared ramekins and bake for 12 minutes, or until the sides of the cakes are firm but the centers are soft. Let the cakes cool in the ramekins for 1 minute, then cover each with an inverted dessert plate. Carefully turn each one over, let stand for 10 seconds and then unmold. Serve immediately.
Light a grill or preheat the broiler. Grill or broil the lemon slices until charred on both sides. Transfer the lemons to a large coarse strainer set over a bowl. Using a wooden spoon, crush all of the juice from the lemons; discard the skins and seeds. Stir in the olive oil and salt.
Melt butter in large pot over medium-high heat. Add leeks and 4 teaspoons thyme; sauté until leeks are almost soft, reducing heat if needed to prevent rapid browning, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer 1/2 cup leeks to small bowl; reserve. Add broccoli and 4 cups broth to pot; bring to boil. Cover; boil until vegetables are tender, 8 to 10 minutes.
Puree soup in blender until smooth. thin soup with more broth, if desired. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle into bowls; sprinkle with 2 teaspoons chopped thyme and reserved leeks.
In a small saucepan, combine the milk and 2 tablespoons of the sugar and heat until steaming and the sugar is dissolved. Put the egg yolk in a small bowl and gradually whisk in the hot milk. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over moderate heat, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.
Off the heat, add the chopped chocolate and salt and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the butter. Pour the custard into 2 shallow bowls and refrigerate briefly, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, beat the heavy cream with the cinnamon and the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar until softly whipped. Dollop the cream on the custards, sprinkle the chocolate shavings on the cream and serve.
Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill.
Preheat an oven to 375°F.
Prick the eggplant with a fork in several places and place on the grill rack 4 to 5 inches from the fire.
Grill, turning frequently, until the skin blackens and blisters and the flesh just begins to feel soft, 10 to 15 minutes.
Transfer the eggplant to a baking sheet and bake until very soft, 15 to 20 minutes.
Remove from the oven, let cool slightly, and peel off and discard the skin.
Place the eggplant flesh in a bowl.
Using a fork, mash the eggplant to a paste.
Add the 1/4 cup tahini, the garlic, the 1/4 cup lemon juice and the cumin and mix well.
Season with salt, then taste and add more tahini and/or lemon juice, if needed.
Transfer the mixture to a serving bowl and spread with the back of a spoon to form a shallow well.
Drizzle the olive oil over the top and sprinkle with the parsley.
Place the olives around the sides.
Serve at room temperature.
1. Mash the feta with the vinegar and herbs with a fork until fairly smooth.
2. Mix in the olive oil and water, until smooth. Because feta cheese can vary in moisture, add more oil, vinegar, or water, if desired.
3. Season with pepper and salt, to taste.
Put the mussels in a sauce pan with 1 tbs of oil. Add wine, set over high heat, cover and steam for about 3 mins. Shaking pan occasionally until the mussels have opened.
Discard the mussels that remain closed. Let cool in the saucepan.
Strain the cooking liquid and set it aside until required.
Heat the remaining oil in a large deep frying pan. Add shallots, then garlic. Saute' for about 1 mins or until it's translucent.
Add salmon and cook for 2 mins or until it's cooked through. 
Remove cooked salmon and set aside. Keep the shallots, garlic, oil in the pan.
Boil water to cook pasta. Salt the water. Cook as stated in the packaging. Drain.
Pour the reserved mussel liquid into frying pan and bring it to a boil. Lower heat and season with salt and pepper. Return the salmon to the pan. Heat for a few seconds then stir in pasta.
Add parsley, dill, and squeeze lemon juice over. Toss well.
Correct seasonings.
Saute' shallots and garlic
Add the fish - I used salmon for the fish but any firm fish will work
Toss well with fresh herbs
Boil water for pasta. Season with salt. Cook to al dente or follow packaged instruction. If you use fresh pasta, it will only take about 4-6 mins.
Heat up a skillet on medium-high heat. Add olive oil and butter. Add shallots. Cook until shallots are getting brown, then add garlic and half portion of sage.
Add sausage and cook until it's cooked through. Remove on a plate and set aside.
With leftover oil, add the remaining sage and bay leaf. Cook for a few mins.
Add wine. Cook until wine is reduced to half, then add chicken stock and pumpkin. Cook until it's mixed and heated. Put cooked sausage back in a skillet. Season with cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
Stir in cream. Cook for another 10-15 mins. Correct seasoning.
Pour the sauce over spaghetti and mix well.
Sprinkle minced parsley.
When serving, top it with grated Parmesan cheese.
Combine flour, salt, and yeast in a bowl ready for an electric mixer. Stir in oil and cold water. At low speed with the dough hook, mix the flour until it is all absorbed. Switch to medium speed and mix for 5-7 mins. The dough will become smooth, sticky, and elastic. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl.
If the dough is too wet and doesn't come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in some more flour.
If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and knead it.
Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the lightly floured space. I use a different process from the original recipe. It works fine for me. At a prepared space, I knead it a few times. I cut the dough into 3 equal pieces or larger if you have a bigger pizza pan. Sprinkle flour over the dough.
Prepare freezer plastic zip lock. Add 1 tbs olive oil and swirl it to coat. 
Put the dough in the zip lock. Place it on the baking tray and refrigerate over night. You can freeze it for up to 3 months according to Peter. Transfer them to thaw in the fridge a day before baking.
When you are ready to make a pizza, take the dough outside the fridge about 30 mins before baking.
Preheat oven to 500 F.
Dust the counter with flour and remove the dough from the bag. Use a pin roll to roll it out flat and to your desired thickness. After rolling, I spin the dough by hand to expand it. 
Generously sprinkle yellow cornmeal on a prepared cast iron pizza pan.
Place the stretched dough on the pan.
Begin to put on your toppings. On this post I used homemade pesto, Monterrey jack and mozzarella cheese, caramelized onions, and Italian cooked sausage. I prefer to have my meat cooked before topping it.
Bake for 12-15 mins.
If you'd like to make it ahead of time so that you won't have to be too busy on the day of, you can chop all the herbs and vegetables in a separate containers. The mayo mixture in another container. On the day of, bake the gyoza skins, mix the mixture and everything else together. Fill the cups before serving.
I used cooked shrimp instead of crab meat but you can change to any kind of seafood you like.
Preheat oven to 350 F. The recipe calls for 375 F but I find it's too hot and sort of burns the gyoza skins. I decrease the temperature and increase time.
Mix mayonnaise, lime juice, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper.
Mix celeray, tomato, chives, jalapeno, zest, and shimps in another bowl.
Mix the mayonnaise mixture into shrimp mixture; refrigerate.
Prepare the gyoza skin. Combine water, honey, and oil in a small bowl.
Brush gyoza skin one at a time with the water mixture on both side.
Place it on a mini muffin tray; pressing it firmly into base of cups.
Repeat it until you fill the tray.
Bake at 350 F for 15 mins or until golden brown. When it's close to 15 mins, check the cups if they are not burn and adjust the time accordingly.
Cool in pans on a wire rack. Carefully remove cups from pans.
Fill each up with the shrimp mixture and serve.
To prepare the crispy pork belly, trim the pork so it is squared off and the edges are neat. Place on a baking sheet. 
In a blender, combine the garlic, pink salt, kosher salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, long pepper, juniper berries, bay leaves, nutmeg and thyme. Blend to a medium-coarse grind. Transfer the curing salt to a bowl. 
Rub a generous amount of the curing salt on the pork belly, coating all sides and shaking off the excess. (This recipe makes enough curing salt to coat up to 5 lb. of pork belly; use less curing salt if your piece of pork is smaller.) Place the pork into a vacuum-sealable bag. Using a vacuum sealer, vacuum and seal the bag tight according to the manufacturer’s instructions; be sure you have a smooth, airtight seal. Place the bag on a baking sheet and refrigerate for 3 to 5 days. 
Prepare a sous vide immersion circulator for use according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Preheat the water to 175°F. 
Remove the pork from the bag, rinse well with cold water to remove the curing salt and pat dry with paper towels. Place the pork into a new vacuum-sealable bag. Using a vacuum sealer, vacuum and seal the bag tight. Carefully place the bag into the circulating water and cook for 12 to 14 hours. 
Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Remove the bag from the circulating water and place the bag into the ice water for 30 minutes. If not serving the pork belly immediately, place the bag on a baking sheet and refrigerate for up to 5 days. (If the pork belly is refrigerated, place the bag in the sous vide immersion circulator set at 145°F and heat until the pork is warm.) 
To make the soup, in a large saucepan over medium heat, cook the pancetta, stirring frequently, until light golden brown and crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the onion, celery and carrots and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are tender and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the chestnuts, stock and bouquet garni and simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Discard the bouquet garni. Transfer the soup to a blender and blend on high speed until smooth. Return the soup to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Set aside and keep warm. 
Meanwhile, in a sauté pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until just tender, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly caramelized and tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and stir in the thyme. Set aside and keep warm. 
Just before serving, remove the pork belly from the bag and cut into 3-oz. squares. Heat a nonstick sauté pan over medium heat. Place the pork, fattiest side down, in the pan and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Turn the pieces over and cook until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate. 
Place 1 piece of crispy pork belly in the center of each of 6 wide soup bowls. Ladle about 1 cup of the soup around each piece of pork. Top with a spoonful of the mushrooms and garnish with chopped chestnuts and celery leaves. Serve immediately.
Season pork with salt, pepper, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper on both sides.
Preheat the oven to 400 F.
Heat up a skillet on medium high heat. Add butter and olive oil. Wait until butter is bubbling, sear pork on both sides. Pour hot butter-oil from the pan over the pork. Pop the skillet in the oven and bake for about 40-45 mins or to your desire of doneness, or the thermometer reaches 165.
In a meantime, heat up another skillet and add 2 tbs butter and olive oil. Add potatoes and beets in a skillet. Season with salt, pepper, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, and sage. Cover with a lid and let the stove works the magic. Stir occasionally. It will take about half hour.
Bring a small sauce pan on a stove. Add balsamic vinegar, berries, and sugar. Bring to boil, then reduce heat to simmer. Simmer it until it's reduced by half.
With leftover beet, cut into match sticks. Pan fried them. Set aside.
Brush the balsamic on pork both sides. Slice the pork and drizzle the balsamic over.
Place sliced pork and drizzle with berry balsamic. Add potato/beet on the side. Top with fried beet.
Marinate shrimp with salt, chili and garlic powders, and saute in a deep wok with sesame oil till cooked through. Remove and set aside.
In the same wok, heat oil and saute ginger, garlic and onions till fragrant and lightly browned. Add in broccoli, bok choy and spaghetti with honey-garlic and soy sauce, and stir-fry for 5-8 minutes till bok choy begins to wilt.
Add in chicken stock and let it come to a boil. Season with salt and pepper.
To serve, stir in shrimp and divide noodles in large bowls.
In a small bowl, beat egg with water. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium low heat. Add egg and leave flat for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from skillet and cut into shreds.
Heat oil in same skillet; add onion and saute until soft. Then add rice, soy sauce, pepper and chicken. Stir fry together for about 5 minutes, then stir in egg. Serve hot.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add collard greens, bacon (with grease), vinegar, salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper.
Boil until greens are tender, about 30 minutes.
Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil, add the quinoa and simmer for 10 minutes. Drain into a fine sieve, run under cold water and then shake well to remove all the water. Leave to cool down.
While the quinoa is on the go, put the vinegar, sugar and salt in a medium mixing bowl and whisk to dissolve. Add the onion and, using your hands, rub the liquid into it. Add the rapeseed oil, stir and set aside to marinate.
Peel the celeriac, cut it into 3mm thick slices and then cut the slices into long, 3mm-wide strips. Place these at once in a large mixing bowl, along with the lemon juice, and stir well – this will help prevent discoloration. Quarter the apples, remove and discard the cores, and cut the fruit into matchstick-shaped pieces similar to the celeriac. Add the apple to the celeriac bowl and stir well, so it, too, gets a protective coat of lemon juice. (The apples and celeriac can also be cut using a mandolin or a food processor.)
To finish, add the onion and any juices from its bowl to the apple and celeriac mix, then stir in the cooked quinoa, poppy seeds, chilli and coriander. Taste and add extra salt, sugar or vinegar, if you need them – you're aiming for a pungent, sweet and sour flavour.
Heat the olive oil and two-thirds of the butter in a large pan and gently sauté the shallots, garlic cloves, thyme and cinnamon for about five minutes, until the onions begin to soften. Add the portobello and chestnut mushrooms, stir well so the mushrooms pick up the oil, and cook for a couple of minutes on a medium-high heat. Add the buna-shimeji and chilli flakes, and cook for a further minute.
Pour in the vegetable stock and simmer over a high heat for eight to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has almost disappeared, and the shallots and garlic are cooked through. Season, then pour in the Pernod. Cook for a minute or two to allow the alcohol to evaporate, then stir through the remaining butter and all the chopped herbs.
Mix the ricotta with the lemon zest in a small bowl. Divide the warm mushrooms between four plates and top each serving with a quarter of the ricotta mixture. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil.
1. Preheat your oven to 180 degrees C and grease a 26cm round cake tin (I just used non-stick baking paper as this ensures easy clean up). Then mix together the flour, salt and 1 and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon in a bowl with a whisk and set aside. Put the butter and brown sugar into a separate bowl and beat till the mixture resembles (and feels like) wet sand.
3. Once the butter is fully incorporated, add the egg and beat will till the mixture is fluffy and creamy and there are no more lumps of sugar.
4. Add the sour cream and vanilla and beat in till well combined.
5. Mix in the flour on low speed till combined, then add your rhubarb chunks and stir briskly to make sure that the rhubarb is completely coated in batter. PLEASE use a large bowl like I did in the pictures, as if you don’t (like my first attempt at this cake), you will end up with a overflowing bowl of messy deliciousness that will go EVERYWHERE!!)
6. Once the mixture is combined, scrape it into your prepared cake tin and sprinkle the top liberally with flaked almonds and caster sugar. I didn’t have any almonds the second time I made this (as you can see in the picture), but I actually found that the top stayed nice and crunchy even longer without the almonds. Go figure!
7. Bake the cake for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or till a wooden skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. Now at this stage you can serve it as a pudding by scooping it out of the container with a large spoon and serving with a dollop of vanilla bean ice cream…but if you wait till it cools down, it tastes even better as a luscious, tender cake with lashings of pure cream.
Preheat oven to 400F / 205C, with a rack in the top third.  Rub olive oil across an 8x8-inch baking dish, or equivalent, and sprinkle with lemon zest.
In a large saucepan over medium-high heat combine the olive oil, onion, and a couple pinches of salt. Cook until the onions soften up and begin to become translucent, a few minutes. Add the farro, stir until well-coated, and cook for another minute or two. Stir in the tomato sauce and the broth. Bring just to a simmer, remove from heat, and stir in about 3/4 of the cheese. Carefully taste a bit of the brothy liquid, and adjust the seasoning if needed. Transfer to the prepared baking dish, cover with foil, poke a few slits in the foil, and bake for about 45 minutes or until the grains are cooked through. You can uncover in the last few minutes to get a bit of color on the top of the farro. Alternatively, you can brown the top carefully under a broiler for a few minutes, which is what I did. Serve sprinkled with the remaining cheese, the fresh oregano, and a drizzle of good olive oil.
If you are using salted herring fillets, they need to be desalted: put them in a dish, cover with milk and let rest for at least 3 hours or overnight in the refrigerator. Drain, rinse with water and pat dry before using.
Clean, trim and boil the broccoli florets until soft (but not falling apart). Drain thoroughly. Add in the crème fraîche and mash with a potato masher or a fork, until it forms a chunky purée. Season with pepper but very little to no salt, as the herring contains a fair amount.
Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
Cut the herring in half-inch chunks, and arrange them in an even layer at the bottom of a medium baking dish. Top with the broccoli purée, flattening the surface with a spatula, and sprinkle with breadcrumbs. (Alternately, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and reproduce this layering in serving circles, to make individual servings as pictured above.)
Put into the oven to bake for twenty minutes or so, until it is thoroughly heated and the breadcrumbs have turned golden. Serve immediately.
