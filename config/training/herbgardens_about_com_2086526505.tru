OT	By Amy Jeanroy , About.com Guide
OT	This soup takes advantage of the young nettle tops. Since you are harvesting them in early spring, there is not reason to handle them excessively. Simply cut them to about 4 inches, if they are any longer. As with any soup, try making a day ahead and reheating for best flavor.
OT	Prep Time: 30 minutes
OT	Cook Time: 30 minutes
