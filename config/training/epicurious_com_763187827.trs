IN	4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves (about 1 1/2 pounds)
IN	1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
IN	1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
IN	1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
IN	1 tablespoon unsalted butter
IN	1 1/2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
IN	2 unpeeled Honeycrisp or Fuji apples, cored and sliced 1/4 inch thick (about 2 1/4 cups)
IN	2 ounces Stilton cheese, crumbled (about 1/3 cup)
PR	Preheat the oven to 425Â°F. Lightly oil a small, rimmed baking sheet with extra-virgin olive oil or coat with nonstick cooking spray. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, and sprinkle with the rosemary.
PR	Melt the butter with the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken for 6 minutes or until browned on both sides, turning once. Transfer to the baking sheet. Add the apple slices to the skillet and cook over medium-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly softened and lightly browned. Spoon the apples around the chicken, placing a couple of slices over each breast.
PR	Bake for 6 minutes or until the chicken feels slightly firm when pressed. Scatter the cheese over the chicken and apples. Continue baking another 2 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the chicken is no longer pink in the center. Serve the chicken with the apples.
