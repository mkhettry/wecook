IN	3/4 pound (3/4 box) spaghetti
IN	Coarse salt
IN	1 lemon
IN	1 1/2 cups finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese
IN	1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
IN	2 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
IN	35 tablespoons of pasta water, to thin
IN	Handful fresh basil leaves (from 4 leafy stems)
PR	Boil the spaghetti in salted boiling water, according to the package directions.
PR	Meanwhile, using a Microplane, grate the zest from the lemon into a large mixing bowl. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice into the bowl (I like to use the grater as a strainerone less thing to clean). Add the 1 1/2 cups Parmesan, pepper, and a pinch of salt, and mix in the olive oil to form a wet paste.
PR	When the spaghetti is perfectly cooked, add 2 or 3 tablespoons of the cooking water to the lemon and cheese mixture. Add the spaghetti to the bowl and toss thoroughly, adding another tablespoon or 2 of pasta water if necessary so that the sauce coats each strand. Roughly tear in the basil leaves.
PR	Serve each portion with a sprinkle of coarse salt, a fresh grind of black pepper, and a few gratings of extra Parmesan.
