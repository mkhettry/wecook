IN	2 cups sugar
IN	2/3 cup honey (preferably Greek)
IN	2 cinnamon sticks
IN	2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
IN	3 cups walnuts (10 to 11 ounces)
IN	3 cups natural raw unsalted pistachios (13 to 14 ounces)
IN	3/4 cup sugar
IN	2 teaspoons finely grated lemon peel
IN	1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
IN	1/2 cup finely diced dried apple rings (1 1/2 ounces)
IN	20 17 x 12-inch sheets fresh phyllo pastry or frozen, thawed
IN	1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, melted
OT	For syrup:
PR	Combine all ingredients and 1 cup water in heavy medium saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium and boil until syrup is reduced to generous 2 cups, about 15 minutes. Transfer to bowl and cool completely. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
OT	For baklava:
PR	Position 1 rack in top third and 1 rack in bottom third of oven and preheat to 350Â°F. Spread walnuts on large rimmed baking sheet. Spread pistachios on another large rimmed baking sheet. Place nuts in oven and toast 5 minutes. Cool nuts. Transfer nuts to processor. Add 3/4 cup sugar, lemon peel, and ground cinnamon. Using on/off turns, blend until nuts are ground to medium-fine texture. Transfer nut mixture to large bowl; mix in dried apples.
PR	Place phyllo sheet stack on work surface; cover with sheet of plastic wrap, then damp kitchen towel. Brush 13 x 9 x 2-inch metal baking pan with some melted butter. Arrange 1 phyllo sheet in pan with half of phyllo sheet hanging over 1 long side. Brush phyllo in pan with some melted butter. Fold overhang over to make two 12 x 8 1/2-inch layers. Brush with some melted butter. Repeat stacking and buttering with 4 more phyllo sheets, making 10 layers total. Spread 1/3 of nut mixture (generous 2 cups) over phyllo in pan to within 1/2 inch of edge. Repeat layering 2 more times with 5 phyllo sheets and 1/3 of remaining nut mixture each time. Top with 5 more folded phyllo sheets. Using sharp knife, cut through top phyllo layers lengthwise (do not cut through to bottom of pan) to make 4 strips, then cut phyllo crosswise to make 16 rectangles. Bake until phyllo is golden, about 45 minutes.
PR	Gradually spoon cold syrup over hot baklava. Cool to room temperature. DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 day ahead. Cover; let stand at room temperature.
PR	Cut each baklava rectangle crosswise in half for total of 32 pieces. Transfer baklava to platter and serve.
