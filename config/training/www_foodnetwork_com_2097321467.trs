Meanwhile, crack eggs into a small mixing bowl and whisk until frothy . Incorporate parsley and chives, and season, to taste, with kosher salt and black pepper. Add eggs to saute pan and gently scramble eggs until just barely cooked.
PR	On a 10-inch plate, pour eggs into a 5-inch diameter ring mold and fold the lobster mixture in. Mixture should be very soft. Garnish with toast and oyster cava cream.
