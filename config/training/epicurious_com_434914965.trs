IN	4 skinless boneless chicken breast halves
IN	Coarse kosher salt
IN	2 1/2 tablespoons butter, divided
IN	2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
IN	2 tablespoons minced shallot
IN	1/4 cup dry white wine
IN	1 cup low-salt chicken broth
IN	2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
IN	2 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon
IN	2 bunches radishes (such as red, pink, purple, and white; about 20), trimmed of all but 1/2 inch of green tops, radishes halved lengthwise
IN	Fresh tarragon sprigs (for garnish)
PR	Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Melt 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken to skillet and cook until browned and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes per side, depending on thickness. Transfer chicken to plate; cover to keep warm. Add shallot to same skillet; stir over medium-high heat 1 minute. Add wine, then broth to skillet; bring to boil. Whisk in mustard and chopped tarragon; boil until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon lightly and is reduced to scant 1/2 cup, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in 1/2 tablespoon butter; set aside.
PR	Meanwhile, melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter with remaining 1 tablespoon oil in heavy medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add radishes; sprinkle with coarse salt and pepper; cook without stirring until radishes begin to brown, about 4 minutes. Continue to cook radishes until crisp-tender, stirring occasionally, 5 to 7 minutes longer.
PR	Cut chicken breast halves crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices; arrange on platter. Place radishes around and over chicken. Spoon sauce over chicken and radishes. Garnish with tarragon sprigs and serve.
