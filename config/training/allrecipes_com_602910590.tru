OT	So easy. I found that the moisture from rinsing the greens was ample to cook the greens. After cooking the bacon (and removing half of the grease) I placed the greens into the skillet with the other ingredients and simmered until tender. I served these on new years day with "slow cooker spicy black-eyed peas" submited by MJ46NY. A delicious combination. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	This is a GREAT, simple recipe! In fact, I made my New Year's greens last year using this recipe and, when I wanted to make them again this year, realized I had lost the recipe! Thankfully, I've found it and will keep it this time. As one of the true "GRITS" (Girls Raised in the South), I can honestly say this is one of the best recipes for good Southern-style greens I've found! :) Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	This was my first time making greens and I was so proud of myself because of this recipe. It took longer than 30 mins to cook but everything worked out. I used smoked hamhock instead of bacon. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	I used a 16oz bag of frozen turnip greens in place of the bunch of collards. The other change I made was to add 2 packets of splenda to try and counteract the bitterness frozen greens tend to have. Really really yummy. Will use this for the rest of the greens in my freezer!

OT	I too have southern back ground and we have always put some sort of pork in with the collard's, but what make's this recipe so good and different is the chicken stock. Plain water just doesn't cut it for me any more... I used a mild hot sauce because of the pepper and it was just great. Thanks for the gift. nan Was this review helpful? [ YES ]
