IN	1/2 cup coarsely grated Fontina cheese
IN	1/3 cup (packed) soft garlic-herb cheese (such as Boursin)
IN	1/3 cup (packed) chopped prosciutto
IN	2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
IN	4 large boneless chicken breast halves with skin
IN	2 tablespoons chilled butter, divided
IN	3/4 cup low-salt chicken broth
IN	1/2 cup dry Marsala
PR	Preheat oven to 300Â°F. Combine cheeses, prosciutto, and basil in small bowl. Season stuffing with freshly ground black pepper.
PR	Run fingers under skin of chicken breasts to loosen. Spread stuffing under skin. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper.
PR	Melt 1 tablespoon butter in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, skin side down, and cook until brown, about 3 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook until chicken is cooked through, turning once, about 10 minutes. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet; place in oven to keep warm. Add broth and marsala to skillet; bring to boil and cook until sauce is reduced to scant 1/2 cup, scraping up browned bits, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat; whisk in 1 tablespoon butter.
