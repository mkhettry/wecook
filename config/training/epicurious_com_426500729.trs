IN	4 (1/2-inch-thick) round slices fresh pineapple (1/2 pineapple)
IN	1/4 cup mild olive oil or vegetable oil
IN	1 medium red onion, finely chopped (1 cup)
IN	1/2 cup chopped cilantro
IN	1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, or more to taste
IN	2 fresh habanero chiles, minced, including seeds
IN	1/2 teaspoon fine salt, or 1 teaspoon kosher salt
PR	Set the oven to broil (alternatively, you can preheat the oven to 500Â°F) and preheat, or heat a lightly oiled grill pan over medium heat. If you're using the oven broiler, position the rack 8 inches from the heat source.
PR	Brush the pineapple slices with some of the oil and roast or grill them until they're browned on both sides and tender, 5 to 6 minutes a side on the grill pan, or 8 minutes a side under the broiler. Let them cool to room temperature.
PR	Dice the pineapple (about 1/8 inch), discarding the core, and mix it in a bowl with the remaining ingredients. Season to taste with additional lime juice and salt.
PR	This salsa keeps in the refrigerator for up to one day.
