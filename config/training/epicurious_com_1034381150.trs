IN	1/3 cup (packed) golden brown sugar
IN	1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
IN	1/3 cup egg whites (from about 3 large eggs)
IN	1/4 teaspoon coarse kosher salt
IN	1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar
IN	1/3 cup sugar
IN	2 teaspoons instant espresso powder
IN	1 cup finely chopped toasted pecans
IN	1/2 cup semisweet or bittersweet chocolate chips (optional)
IN	18 (about) untoasted pecan halves
PR	Preheat oven to 300Â°F. Line heavy large baking sheet with parchment paper. Press brown sugar and cocoa powder through sieve into small bowl to remove any lumps; whisk to blend. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites, coarse salt, and cream of tartar in medium bowl until very soft peaks begin to form. With mixer running, gradually add sugar, then espresso powder; beat until medium peaks form. Beat in brown sugar mixture by tablespoonfuls. Continue beating until meringue is very stiff and glossy, 2 to 3 minutes. Fold in chopped pecans and chocolate chips, if desired. Drop mixture by rounded tablespoonfuls onto prepared sheet, spacing about 1 inch apart. Place 1 pecan half atop each meringue, pressing very lightly to adhere.
PR	Bake meringues until dry but still slightly soft when pressed with finger, about 25 minutes. Turn off oven. Cool meringues in oven with door closed until crisp, about 1 1/2 hours. DO AHEAD: Meringues can be made up to 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
