OT	MACARONI CHEESE
NO	This is the shortcut version: no cheese sauce, but a gorgeously huge amount of cheese, bound with egg and evaporated milk. Yum.
OT	Ingredients
IN	250g macaroni
IN	250g mature Cheddar or red Leicester or a mixture of both
IN	250ml evaporated milk
IN	2 eggs grating of fresh nutmeg
IN	Salt and pepper
OT	Method
PR	Preheat the oven to 220Â°C/gas mark 7. Cook the macaroni according to the packet instructions, drain and then put back into the hot pan.
PR	While the pasta is cooking, put the cheese, evaporated milk, eggs and nutmeg in a processor and blitz to mix. Or grate the cheese and mix everything by hand.
PR	Pour the cheese sauce over the macaroni, stir well, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
PR	Tip into a 25.5cm-diameter dish (wide and shallow is best) and bake in the very hot oven for about 10-15 minutes, or until it is bubbling and blistering on top.
FO	Serves: 4
