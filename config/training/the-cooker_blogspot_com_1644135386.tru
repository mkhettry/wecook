OT	Quinoa-Carrot Pulao
OT	If it doesn't contain any rice is it still a pulao?
OT	This is a riff on the classic carrot-pulao.
OT	I go thru these phases where I make an extra effort to eat less rice.
OT	During one such phase, when a friend mentioned how she has virtually given up rice and instead eats quinoa I was all ears.
OT	Even before we could complete our conversation, in my mind the carrot-pulao had morphed into a quinoa-carrot!
OT	This is an incredibly aromatic pulao and no, we didn't miss the rice one bit.
OT	Equally delicious when hot or at room temperature. I'll be making this pulao quite often. The next time I do, I'll swap out the blurred photo.
