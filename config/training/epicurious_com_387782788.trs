IN	1 (4 by 4-inch) square frozen store-bought puff pastry, preferably all-butter (such as Dufour brand), defrosted
IN	3 tablespoons unsweetened dried cherries
IN	3 teaspoons Mulled Wine Syrup , made with red wine
IN	2 tablespoons sliced almonds
IN	2 tablespoons low-fat Greek-style yogurt, whisked smooth
PR	Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
PR	On a lightly floured countertop, roll out the puff pastry to about 6 inches square. Pierce the dough every 1/2 inch with a fork; this helps the pastry rise more evenly. Mound the cherries in the center of the dough and drizzle 2 teaspoons of the red wine syrup over them (but not the pastry). Lightly moisten the edges of the dough with water, pull it up, and fold it over to the edges of the cherries, forming pleats so that it cradles the fruit. Scatter the almonds on top.
PR	Transfer the tart to the prepared baking sheet and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the pastry has puffed and turned golden brown. Remove it from the oven and let cool for a few minutes. Transfer to a dessert plate, drizzle with the remaining 1 teaspoon of red wine syrup, spoon on a dollop of yogurt, and eat.
