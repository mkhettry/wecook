NO	I'm sort of back.
NO	Thank you for all the kind words and encouragement. You guys rock!
NO	The I'm-not-in-the-mood-to-blog/cook moment happens to everyone, it seems like. At the end, we all go back to where we belong and are happy - cooking/baking. During the break, I dined out, traveled, read more books, and checked out inspiring blogs. All these things gave me motivation and energy. My appetite is back, at least for now.
NO	I hope everyone had a great Chinese New Year and super bowl. I was happily full; that's all I can say!
NO	I finally got around to this inked spaghetti I bought in Italy last October. Yeah..I know...I just got my hands on it now. The color makes a dramatic presentation and adds a wow factor to the finish. It's really easy, light, and elegant. This is my first time working on live mussels. Keith doesn't like them that much so I don't get a chance too often. However, for this type of spaghetti, it couldn't be better than with seafood. Keith doesn't like squid and scallops so he left me only a few options - shrimp and fish. I work for a shrimp importing company so they don't excite me that much. I decided to go with mussels and fish.
NO	Please feel free to add any kind of seafood you like.
OT	PS: I got really busy at work but I will catch up with my favorite blogs very soon!
