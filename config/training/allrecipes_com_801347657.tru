OT	This was a good recipe. It did need a little more flavor. I added more parmesan cheese and more salt and that really was enough to make everyone inhale it. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	This is always been one of my favorite pasta dishes. I used pancetta instead of bacon, cooking the pancetta in olive oil until lightly crisp. I added another 1/4 cup of Parmesan to the dish and a pinch of salt to the cream to heighten the flavors. Some sauted crimni mushrooms rounded out the dish. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	very good-just be careful not to overcook the cream sauce mixture or the eggs will cook independently of the cream. Also add some ham and mushrooms for added zest. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]
