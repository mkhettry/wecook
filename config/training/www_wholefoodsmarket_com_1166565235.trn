NO	Colorful, flavorful heirloom tomatoes star in these classic sandwiches. Also try making a BLT salad: stir the mayonnaise and pesto into 2 tablespoons of your favorite vinaigrette, then toss with lots of chopped lettuce, tomatoes, crumbled bacon or tempeh, and homemade croutons.

PR	Lay bread out on a work surface. Combine mayonnaise and pesto; spread evenly over one side of each bread slice. Sprinkle tomatoes with salt and layer onto half the bread slices. Top tomatoes with bacon and lettuce, and cover with remaining bread slices. Cut each sandwich in half on the diagonal and pile onto a platter.
