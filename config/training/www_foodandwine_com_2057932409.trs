IN	1/4 cup crème fraîche
IN	1/4 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
IN	1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
IN	1 tablespoon snipped chives
IN	3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
IN	Salt and freshly ground pepper
IN	6 jumbo scallops (about 3/4 pound)
IN	6 thin slices pancetta (about 2 ounces)
IN	1/2 pound brussels sprouts, thinly sliced
IN	1 shallot, thinly sliced
IN	1 tablespoon unsalted butter
IN	1 garlic clove, minced
PR	In a small bowl, whisk the crème fraîche with the finely grated lemon zest, fresh lemon juice, snipped chives and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Season the lemon-chive crème fraîche with salt and pepper.
PR	In a medium skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil until shimmering. Generously season the scallops with salt and pepper and add them to the skillet. Cook the scallops over moderately high heat, turning once, until they are golden and just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer the scallops to a plate; tent with aluminum foil to keep warm.
PR	Meanwhile, in another medium skillet, cook the pancetta over moderately high heat, turning once, until browned and crisp, about 4 minutes. Add the brussels sprouts and shallot and cook, stirring, until the brussels sprouts are softened but still bright green, about 2 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the butter and garlic and season with salt and pepper; transfer to plates and top with the scallops. Serve with the lemon-chive crème fraîche.
