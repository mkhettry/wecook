IN	5 medium white button mushrooms
IN	1/2 (10-ounce) box frozen chopped spinach, defrosted
IN	3 sprigs fresh rosemary
IN	10 ounces large pimiento-stuffed green olives
IN	Zest of 1 orange
IN	Zest of 1 small lemon
IN	1 (3-pound) veal roast, netted and tied
IN	Fine sea salt
IN	Freshly ground black pepper
IN	2 tablespoons olive oil
IN	2 tablespoons honey
IN	6 tablespoons apricot preserves
IN	2 teaspoons imitation mustard
PR	Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
PR	Place the mushrooms, the 1/2-box defrosted spinach, leaves from the rosemary sprigs, olives, orange zest, and lemon zest into the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Pulse to combine to a paste.
PR	Untie the roast. Season both sides with salt and pepper. Spread the stuffing paste evenly over the surface of the veal, generously covering it.
PR	Reroll the roast and tie it just tightly enough to secure; don't tie too tightly or the filling will all ooze out. The filling will be visible.
PR	Heat the olive oil in a large skillet. Add the veal roast and sear on all sides until the meat is a deep golden-brown. Place the seared roast into a roasting pan.
PR	In a small bowl, mix the honey, apricot preserves, and mustard. Rub all the meat surfaces with a thick coating of the apricot-honey mixture, reserving some mixture. Bake for 1 hour, covered. Remove the roast from the oven and baste with remaining apricot-honey mixture. Return to the oven, uncovered, for 15 more minutes. Allow the roast to stand for 10 minutes before slicing. The roast should be juicy and slightly pink in the center.
