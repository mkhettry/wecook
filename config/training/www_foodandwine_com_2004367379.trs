IN	1 teaspoon finely grated ginger
IN	1 garlic clove, mashed to a paste
IN	2 teaspoons ground coriander
IN	1 teaspoon ground cumin
IN	3 tablespoons canola oil
IN	1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds
IN	1 small shallot, minced
IN	1 tablespoon tomato paste mixed with 1 tablespoon of water
IN	1 1/4 cups dried green lentils
IN	1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
IN	4 ounces green beans, cut into 3/4-inch lengths
IN	4 ounces kale, stemmed and leaves finely chopped
IN	1 medium carrot, thinly sliced
IN	1 cup finely chopped cilantro
IN	1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
IN	Salt
PR	In a small bowl, combine the ginger, garlic, coriander and ground cumin. Stir in 1/4 cup of water to make a paste. In a small skillet, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the cumin seeds and cook over moderately high heat for 5 seconds, just until sizzling. Add the shallot and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Add the spice paste and let cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook until thick, about 1 minute longer.
PR	In a saucepan, combine the lentils with the turmeric and 5 cups of water; bring to a boil. Cover partially and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes, until the lentils are barely tender. Add the green beans, kale, carrot, three-fourths of the cilantro and the cayenne and season with salt. Cook until the lentils and vegetables are tender, 15 minutes. Scrape in the spice paste and the remaining cilantro. Simmer for 5 minutes, then serve.
