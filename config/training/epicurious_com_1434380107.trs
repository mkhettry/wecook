IN	4 pounds fatty pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch pieces
IN	3 cups water
IN	1 medium white onion, thinly sliced
IN	1/2 orange, cut into 2 pieces
IN	1/4 cup pork lard or vegetable oil
IN	8 garlic cloves, peeled
IN	3 bay leaves
IN	1 tablespoon sweetened condensed milk
IN	2 teaspoons dried oregano, preferably Mexican, crumbled
IN	2 teaspoons fine salt, or 4 teaspoons kosher salt
PR	Put all the ingredients in a wide 6-to 7-quart heavy pot (don't worry if the pork is not completely covered) and bring the water to a boil, skimming the surface as necessary. Lower the heat and simmer vigorously, stirring occasionally, until the pork is fork-tender and the liquid has completely evaporated, 1½ to 2 hours. Discard the orange pieces and bay leaves. If the liquid hasn't evaporated after 2 hours, transfer the pork pieces to a bowl and let the liquid continue to bubble away, stirring often, until it has.
PR	Preheat the oven to 450°F. Transfer the pork and fat to an ovenproof dish, if necessary, and brown the pork, uncovered, in the oven for 20 to 30 minutes. There's no need to stir.
PR	Carnitas keeps in the refrigerator for up to three days.
PR	Note: If you want to make half a batch, cut the amount of pork, salt, and oregano in half, but use the same amount of the remaining ingredients and water. You will need to use a slightly smaller pot.
