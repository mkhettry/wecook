IN	4 tablespoons tomato paste
IN	3 tablespoons honey
IN	1 tablespoon lemon juice
IN	1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
IN	1 teaspoon hot sauce
IN	1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
IN	Sea salt
IN	1 pound large, peeled, and deveined prawns
IN	1 cup polenta
IN	1 1/4 cups (10 ounces) corn kernels, fresh or frozen
IN	1/4 cup currants
IN	1 tablespoon honey
IN	1 tablespoon butter
IN	1 teaspoon fresh thyme, or 1/2 teaspoon dried
IN	Sea salt
IN	Black pepper
IN	1/3 cup feta cheese, crumbled
IN	2 to 3 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped
IN	2 tablespoons capers
IN	Hot sauce (optional)
PR	1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). Butter an 8 x 10-inch (20.3 x 25.4 cm) baking dish. Oil a rimmed baking sheet with olive oil. Set the pans aside.
PR	2. To make the marinade: Combine the tomato paste, honey, lemon juice, olive oil, hot sauce, garlic powder, and a pinch or two of salt in a medium bowl. Toss the prawns with the marinade. Set the bowl aside, giving it a stir every few minutes.
PR	3. For the polenta: Bring 3 cups cold water to a boil in a medium stainless-steel pot. Add the polenta. Cook seven minutes, stirring often. Remove the pot from the heat, cover, and let sit for 10 minutes.
PR	4. In a large bowl, mix the corn (completely thawed if frozen), currants, honey, butter, and thyme. Stir in the polenta, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
PR	5. Add polenta mixture to the buttered baking dish. Spread evenly with a spatula, and place in the oven to bake for 35 minutes.
PR	6. Spread the prawn mixture evenly onto the oiled baking sheet. After the polenta has baked for 25 minutes, add the prawns to the oven, alongside the polenta. Place both pans on same rack if possible; otherwise, place the baking sheet on the lower rack.
PR	7. Bake the prawns for five minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, and flip all of the prawns over. Return to the oven and bake an additional five minutes, until the polenta is slightly browned and the prawns are pink and firm.
PR	8. Remove the prawns and the polenta from the oven. To serve, scoop individual servings of the polenta onto plates. Lay a few prawns over each serving, then top with crumbled feta, fresh parsley, and capers. Drizzle with a few lashings of hot sauce, if desired.
