Preparation Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss crumbs with 2 teaspoons mustard, 2 teaspoons oil, and mustard seeds in medium bowl to coat.
Scatter on rimmed baking sheet. Bake until golden and crisp, 6 to 8 minutes.
Meanwhile, add enough water to deep large nonstick skillet to cover bottom. Add spinach; toss over high heat to wilt, about 2 minutes. Scrape into sieve set over bowl; press out liquid. Wipe out skillet; reserve.
Transfer spinach to medium saucepan. Add 3 teaspoons mustard, half and half, and chopped thyme. Stir over medium heat until thick, about 3 minutes. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Remove from heat.
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in reserved skillet over medium-high heat. Crack eggs into skillet, spacing apart. Fry until whites are cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Divide spinach between 2 plates, spreading out as base for eggs. Top with eggs, crumbs, and thyme sprigs.

The sandwiches can also be made on a split baguette or rustic loaf such as ciabatta. After layering the ingredients in the loaf, cut into 4 individual sandwiches and serve.
Ingredients: 4 crusty rolls, such as Portuguese rolls, split horizontally
4 tsp. Dijon mustard
2 cups roasted pork, thinly sliced (see related recipe at left)
1 lb. smoked ham or Genoa salami, thinly sliced
1/2 lb. Swiss cheese, thinly sliced
1/2 cup dill pickle slices
2 Tbs. unsalted butter, melted
Directions: Assemble the sandwiches
Preheat a heavy fry pan or grill pan over medium-high heat. Spread the bottom of each roll with mustard. Layer the pork, ham, cheese and pickles on the rolls, dividing evenly. Set the top halves in place and press gently. Brush the tops of the rolls with the melted butter.
Grill the sandwiches
Place the sandwiches in the heated pan and weight with a second pan or a weighted press. Grill until the undersides are golden, about 2 1/2 minutes. Turn the sandwiches over, weight again, and cook until the other sides are golden and the cheese is melted, about 2 1/2 minutes more. Serve immediately. Serves 4.

antipasti of mozzarella, chilli, and lemon crostini starter     | serves 4
Heat a griddle pan until its really smoking hot, then griddle each slice of ciabatta for a couple of minutes on each side until they are nicely charred.
Cut the garlic clove in half, rub each ciabatta slice with garlic and drizzle with a little olive oil. Tear the mozzarella evenly over the 8 crostini. Season well with salt and pepper, sprinkle over the sliced chilli and basil leaves and grate over the lemon zest. Finish with another drizzle of olive oil.

1. trentjohrns Tue 28 Jul 2009 @ 21:51 Because my newlywed wife has a gastro-intestinal problem and cannot eat spicy food, it has sometimes been difficult to find recipes that are tasty but not too harsh on her digestive tract. I cannot thank you enough, Mr. Oliver, for this apple & horseradish chutney recipe that I uncovered in the "dressings/sauces" section of your celebrity chef web recipe site. It is so simple and easy to make with only three ingredients: apples, horseradish, and lemon juice. When I made this for my wife, I did not have 400g apples, peeled and cored, nor do I own any type of scale, so I am not entirely sure that the ratio of ingredients I ended up with was the same that you prescribe, but essentially I mixed a jar of prepared horseradish with a jar of apple sauce, and I think it tasted alright.
My wife was so surprised! She even inspected it closely and asked me what it was that I had served her, to which I responded "chutney, dear". In any case, I think she liked it because she was adamant that she save much of it as leftovers to enjoy later.

aioli dressings / sauces     | serves 8
Aïoli is a lovely fragrant and pungent type of mayonnaise  and the great thing is that you can take the flavour in any direction  try adding some pounded or chopped basil, fennel tops, dill or roasted nuts. Also great flavoured with lemon zest and juice. Its normally seasoned well and is used to enhance things like fish stew in order to give them a real kick. You might wonder why I suggest using 2 types of olive oil to make this. By blending a strong peppery one with a mellower one you achieve a lovely rounded flavour.
Smash up the garlic with 1 teaspoon of salt in a pestle and mortar (or use the end of a rolling pin in a metal bowl). Place the egg yolk and mustard in a bowl and whisk together, then start to add your olive oils bit by bit. Once youve blended in a quarter of the oil you can start to add the rest in larger amounts. When its all gone in, add the garlic and lemon juice and any extra flavours (see above). To finish it off, season to taste with salt, pepper and a bit more lemon juice if needed.
Try this: Lemon- or basil-flavoured aïoli are good with salads, all types of fish, and in seafood soups. Also great with roasted fish, chicken or pork, and classic with salmon.

1. Fabbo36 Thu 03 Feb 2011 @ 05:46 Nice recipe! What is the shelf life please?<br />
2. Aims Tue 21 Dec 2010 @ 06:18 Oh dear lord, does it really matter where this dressing originated from and or how the word is pronounced?
Jamie, i am going to give this a shot with some freshly cooked prawns (cooled) and add some finley chopped sweet pickles for our christmas appetizer mmm yum
3. peteriiino! Fri 22 Jan 2010 @ 07:54 "Aïoli" or "all i oli" or how ever you might be calling it, is neither Spanish nor French nor Italian! It is originally from the Middle-East and specifically from the Lebanon! The Arabs took it over from the Lebanese indeed and introduced it in Europe in the middle-ages when they colonized and ruled Andalucia in nowadays Spain! Voila!
4. Isabel Sat 21 Nov 2009 @ 18:06 The correct name is " ALL I OLI", it's made from Catalonia (Spain) but is in all de country. all i oli is written in Catalan, in Castilian (spanish) means ajo y aceite, which in english is garlic and olive oil.
In Spain also made with egg but now is just a garlic mayonnaise is not "all i oli",OK??
5. Ida Sun 15 Nov 2009 @ 01:47 The correct name is "all i oli" and it's from Catalonia...YES!! from SPAIN and it's not a Mayonesa...it's just oil and garlic with salt...so please change the name of that sauce, bacause it's not ALL I OLI...this sauce is just mayonesa with garlic...and mustard??? come on! I can't believe that...please fix it...
Ashlee...all i oli in Italy or France? well... I don't think so
And Mara ...mediterranean is not only France or Italy...the closest part to Spain? NO, it's from Spain...
I can't understand why there are so many problems with Spain and spanish things in general...
6. Mara Thu 24 Sep 2009 @ 10:31 Where in Italy? I knew It is cooked in France (the Mediterranean zone, specially de closest part to Spain) but i've never heard about Italy.
7. Ashlee Fri 07 Aug 2009 @ 23:11 It's made in Spain, France and Italy and there is no proof about where it originated. So while "all i oli" might be correct in Spain, in the English-speaking world we call it the French name, aïoli.
8. Mara Wed 17 Jun 2009 @ 09:01 Here in Spain (in Catalonia and Valencia, where is very popular) is called, as Natalia said, "all i oli". That means garlic and oil and that's exactly what we use to cook it: garlic, oil (olive oil of course) and a pinch of salt. We eat it with fish paella and fideuà, but also with roasted meat or fish.
I'm just giving information not criticizing. Jamie's recipe must be delicious and I'm going to try.
9. Natàlia Mon 08 Jun 2009 @ 15:04 I'm sorry, but the correct name is "all i oli" and it's from Catalonia.
Thank you.

fruit recipes Fruit is a lovely addition to many meals, savoury or sweet. If you've never tried cooking with fruit before, then why not try sweet duck legs cooked with plums and star anise or Jamie's good old apple crumble for dessert.

Ingredients Makes about 1 dozen
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
1 large egg, room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Directions Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together into a bowl. Beat butter and sugar with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla. Reduce speed to low. With machine running, gradually add flour mixture; mix until combined. Shape into a disk, and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until firm, at least 45 minutes (or up to 3 days).
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Roll to 1/8 inch thick. Using a 5-inch-tall bunny-shaped cookie cutter, cut out cookies. Space 2 inches apart on parchment-lined baking sheets. Reroll scraps, and cut out. Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.
Bake until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool completely on sheets on wire racks. Cookies can be stored in airtight containers at room temperature up to 1 week.

Pantry staples, chicken, and fast-cooking pasta add up to an impressive 25-minute meal.
Prep: 25 minutes
Total: 25 minutes
Ingredients Serves 4
Coarse salt and ground pepper
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
8 thin chicken cutlets (about 1 1/2 pounds total)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
1 can (14 ounces) artichoke hearts packed in water, rinsed, drained, and quartered
2 tablespoons rinsed and drained capers
2 tablespoons butter
8 ounces angel-hair pasta
1/2 cup parsley leaves
Directions Set a large pot of salted water to boil. Place flour in a shallow dish, and season with salt and pepper. Dredge cutlets, shaking off excess. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high. Cook chicken in batches, adding remaining oil as needed, until light golden, 1 to 3 minutes per side; transfer to a dish.
Add broth to skillet, and bring to a boil; cook until reduced by half. Add artichokes, capers, and the chicken with any juices. Gently swirl to combine, and bring just to a boil. Remove skillet from heat. Swirl in butter, and cover to keep warm.
Add pasta to boiling water. Cook until al dente; drain. Serve chicken and sauce over pasta, topped with parsley.

Ingredients Makes 8
1 tablespoon white vinegar
8 large eggs
Hollandaise Sauce
1/2 pound (16 slices)  Canadian bacon
4 English muffins, split in half, toasted
Directions Fill a large saucepan with about 4 inches of water, add vinegar, and bring to a boil. Fill a shallow dish or pie plate with warm water. Reduce heat under saucepan to medium, so water is just barely simmering. Break 1 egg at a time into a small heat-proof bowl. Gently tip bowl into water; carefully slide egg into water. Repeat with remaining eggs.
When eggs begin to become opaque, remove them from the saucepan with a slotted spoon in the order in which they were added. Transfer the eggs to the dish of warm water. This process should take about 3 minutes.
Prepare the hollandaise sauce, and set aside, keeping it warm.
Heat a medium skillet over medium heat. Add Canadian bacon, and cook until well browned on both sides. Divide bacon among the English-muffin halves. For each serving, use a slotted spoon to remove one egg from warm water; set spoon and egg briefly on a clean cloth or paper towel to drain. Gently place the egg on a bacon-topped muffin, and spoon the reserved warm hollandaise sauce over the top.

We brined our turkey for 24 hours, so leave plenty of time for this recipe. If you don't brine yours, skip steps 1 and 2. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends cooking the turkey until the thickest part of the thigh registers 180 degrees. For a moister bird, we cooked ours to 165 degrees; it will continue to cook outside the oven as it rests.
To make this recipe as seen on "The Martha Stewart Show," use our Gravy 101 recipe instead of the gravy recipe below, and use 20 cups of water for the brine instead of 10.

NOW PLAYING:
Ingredients Serves 12 to 14
3 cups coarse salt, plus more for seasoning
5 cups sugar
2 medium onions, coarsely chopped
2 medium leeks, white and pale-green parts only, rinsed and coarsely chopped
2 carrots, peeled and coarsely chopped
2 celery stalks, coarsely chopped
2 dried bay leaves
3 sprigs fresh thyme
3 sprigs fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns, plus freshly ground pepper
1 fresh whole turkey (18 to 20 pounds), rinsed and patted dry, giblets and neck reserved for gravy
Gravy
1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), melted, plus 1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc
Chestnut Stuffing
Crab apples, fresh rosemary sprigs, and fresh sage, for garnish (optional)
Directions Put salt, sugar, onions, leeks, carrots, celery, bay leaves, thyme, parsley, peppercorns, and 10 cups water in a large stockpot. Bring to a boil, stirring until salt and sugar have dissolved. Remove from heat; let brine cool completely.
Add turkey, breast first, to the brine. Cover; refrigerate 24 hours. Remove from brine; pat dry with paper towels. Let stand at room temperature 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees, with rack in lowest position. Stir together melted butter and wine in a medium bowl. Fold a very large piece of cheesecloth into quarters so that it is large enough to cover breast and halfway down sides of turkey. Immerse cloth in butter mixture; let soak.
Place turkey, breast side up, on a rack set in a roasting pan. Fold wing tips under turkey. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper inside turkey. Loosely fill body and neck cavities with stuffing. Tie legs together with kitchen twine. Fold neck flap under; secure with toothpicks. Rub turkey all over with softened butter; season with salt and pepper.
Remove cheesecloth from butter mixture, squeezing gently into bowl. Reserve butter mixture for brushing. Lay cheesecloth over turkey. Place turkey, legs first, in oven. Roast 30 minutes. Brush cheesecloth and exposed turkey with butter mixture. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees. Roast, brushing every 30 minutes, 2 1/2 hours more; cover with foil if browning too quickly. If making gravy, add giblets and neck to pan 1 1/2 hours after reducing temperature; roast 30 minutes, and reserve.
Discard cheesecloth; rotate pan. Baste turkey with pan juices. Roast, rotating pan halfway through, until skin is golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 180 degrees and stuffing reaches 165 degrees, about 1 hour. Transfer to a platter. Set pan with drippings aside for gravy. Let turkey stand at room temperature at least 30 minutes. Garnish, if desired.

How to Make Crème Fraîche (in One Easy Step!)
Posted by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt ,

Tags: buttermilk , crème fraîche , heavy cream
For those of you who pay attention, yes, we did talk about this back in August . I just feel like minds weren't sufficiently blown that time around. Certainly, mine wasn't, so I thought I'd share my feelings on the matter.
Me: "I'm going to need crème fraîche for the dinner I'm cooking tomorrow. But dangit if my local supermarket only carries heavy cream and buttermilk!"
Buddy: "You know you can just mix heavy cream and buttermilk, let it sit overnight, and you've got crème fraîche, right?"
Me: "Auauhungh?" Mind = blown.
OK, that conversation didn't really happen, but the first time I mixed buttermilk and heavy cream and let it sit overnight until it became thick and creamy, my mind was honestly more blown than it had been since finding out that Brad Pitt and Edward Norton share a body .
And here I thought making ricotta was easy!
I played around with the ratios of cream to buttermilk quite a bit and in the end found that it doesn't really matter all that much. Add more buttermilk and you'll need less time for it to thicken (but it'll be less creamy). Add more, and it takes longer, but tastes better. One tablespoon per cup (that's a 1:16 ratio) was about the perfect balance for me.
It gets super rich and creamy at right about the 12-hour mark. You can also halt the process early by just refrigerating it to stop the bacterial action. This is useful if you want a thinner Mexican-style crema agria for drizzling over tacos or sopes . For those of you worried about cream spoiling at room temp, that's the idea: it's the good bacteria from the buttermilk multiplying in there that prevents the dangerous bacteria from taking over.
And let the mind-blowing begin. Commence countdown.
Ingredients serves Makes 2 cups , active time 1 minute, total time 12 hours
1 pint heavy cream
2 tablespoons cultured buttermilk
Procedures
1
Combine buttermilk and heavy cream in non-reactive container. Cover and allow to rest at room temperature until thickened to desired texture, about 12 hours. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

Dinner Tonight: Pan-Roasted Whole Fish with Olives

Tags: capers , fish , Mario Batali , Molto Mario , olives , whole fish
For me, the best part of a fish is its skin.  Much like the treasured outside of a roast chicken, the skin is crisp, salty, and deeply flavorful —that is, when it's cooked properly.  I never understand the virtue of a fillet of fish without the skin and always try to buy a whole fish with it still on whenever possible.  Not only is it cheaper, but you get all kinds of textures and anything cooked whole and on the bone with cartilage and connective tissue will be moister and more delicious.
I turned to Mario Batali for this recipe from his book Molto Mario .  He calls for a whole large snapper to feed four, which is the recipe I'm repeating here, but I cooked mine with a small branino for two.  Either way, the sauce is marvelous: black olives, capers, white, and lemon zest are spooned into the skillet after the fish gets a thorough searing over high heat. In the oven, it practically melts with the pan juices. Parsley, flaky salt, and a drizzle of olive oil on top and it's ready.
Ingredients serves 4 , active time 25, total time 35
1 3-4 pound whole fish, such as snapper, scored with a sharp knife three times on each side
flour for dredging
6 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling
1 cup black olives (preferably Gaeta), pitted and coarsely chopped
3 tablespoons capers, preferably salt-packed and rinsed if so
5 lemons, 3 of them zested and segmented
1 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup minced flat-leaf parsley
flaky sea salt to taste
Procedures

Preheat oven to 450 degreed Fahrenheit.  Dredge fish in flour on both sides and shake off excess.  Heat olive oil in a heavy, oven-proof skillet large enough to hold the fish over medium-high heat until just smoking.  Lay fish carefully in the pan and cook without touching until golden brown.
2
Turn fish over carefully and add olives, capers, lemon zest and segments, juice from remaining lemons, and wine.
3
Transfer skillet to oven. Roast fish until fish is just cooked through, 10-15 minutes depending on thickness.  Remove from oven and allow to rest at least 5 minutes.
4
Serve whole fish tableside or fillet onto plates.  Top with parsley, flaky salt, and a drizzle of olive oil.  Serve immediately.

Dinner Tonight: Farro Salad with Roasted Kale and Beets

[ Photograph: Blake Royer ]
In Autumn begins a season of roasting. The snap of cold air is here to stay, earthy vegetables like beets are in season, and nothing beats the deep flavor of caramelization the oven provides. That was the only inspiration for this recipe—that and the remains of my last shipment of vegetables from this year's CSA. I slid the red and golden beets (peeled and sliced thin) and a leafy bunch of kale into the oven and set out to figure out how to serve them.
The answer came when I found a bag of farro in the pantry, the nutty grain that's as healthy as brown rice but cooks in half the time (while tasting twice as good). It never seems to get mushy and pairs perfectly with in-season vegetables (In summer, I tossed it with sautéed slices of zucchini with plenty of garlic, and added a dollop of pesto). The roasted kale was especially cool, tender in parts and starting to crisp in others, which added fantastic texture, and even though the beets turned my entire dinner pink, I sort of liked it. Though it's not pictured, the pièce de résistance was crumbles of goat cheese which took it to the next level of awesome. I was surprised at how delicious it all came out, the way simple in-season food often does.
The filling farro makes this a satisfying main.  But I'm also filing this away for Thanksgiving.  It would make a perfect side dish or, sans goat cheese, a vegan main course. Carrots, parsnips, and many other root vegetables could join or stand in for the beets.
Ingredients serves 4 to 6
3 beets, peeled and thinly sliced on a mandoline
2 bunches kale, tough ribs removed and leaves roughly torn
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
3 tablespoons olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 pound farro (pearlized)
2 tablespoons lemon juice from 1 lemon
3 ounces fresh goat cheese
Procedures
1
Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 400°F. Spread  beets, kale, and garlic on rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper, and toss to combine. Roast until the beets are soft and the kale is tender, 20-30 minutes.
2
Meanwhile, cover farro with cold water in  medium saucepan, season with salt, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain excess water, then add roasted vegetables and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and lemon juice and divide amongst bowls. Crumble goat cheese and serve hot or warm.

Bread Baking: Rye with Caraway and Flax

[ Photograph: Donna Currie ]
I'll admit that I was a little bit slow jumping on the flax seed bandwagon. Maybe it was an anti-hype reaction. Everyone was saying how good they are for you, and I instinctively recoiled. Because if all that's being said it how healthy they are, then flavor must not be a selling point.
Besides, I had plenty of other favorite seeds to dump into bread. I adore sesame seeds, caraway belongs in rye, and of course poppy seeds are a must on Chicago-style hot dog buns.
But while I can easily resist hype, I have a hard time resisting a great sale, so when I saw a bag of ground flax seeds at a bargain price, I figured that I had nothing to lose. And then I saw whole flax seeds at the bulk food store and I figured that a little bag wouldn't break the bank.
Before I baked with them, I sampled the whole light flax seeds and I was surprised to find they actually tasted good. I was expecting them to be tasteless at best, but instead they tasted sort of a like a cross between sunflower seeds and sesame seeds . Oh yes, I could do something with these. And I could feel virtuous at the same time because flax is good for...something.
About the author: Donna Currie has been cooking for fun and writing for pay since the days when typewritten articles traveled by snail mail. When she combined those talents in a food column for a newspaper in her area, she realized that writing about food is almost as much fun as eating. She launched the blog Cookistry and has now joined the Serious Eats team with a weekly column about baking.
Ingredients serves Makes 1 loaf , active time 40 minutes, total time 3 hours 15 minutes
1 cup lukewarm water
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
1 cup (3 3/4 ounces) medium rye flour
1/4 cup flax meal
9 ounces (about 1 2/3 cups) bread flour, divided
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup Greek-style yogurt
1 tablespoon whole flax seeds
2 tablespoons caraway seeds
1 tablespoon olive oil
Procedures
1
Combine the water, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of your stand mixer and set aside until it's foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the rye flour, flax meal and about half of the bread flour. Stir to combine, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside for 20 minutes.
2
Knead with the dough hook until the gluten begins developing, about 5 minutes. Then add the remaining bread flour, salt, and yogurt. Knead with the dough hook until the mixture is elastic. Add the seeds and oil and continue kneading until the oil is incorporated and the seeds are well distributed in the dough. Form the dough into a ball and drizzle with a bit of olive oil to coat. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside until doubled, about 1 hour.
3
Flour your work surface and preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Sprinkle some cornmeal on a baking sheet. Remove the dough from the bowl and form it into your preferred shape. Place it on the prepared baking sheet, seam-side down, and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside until it has doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
4
Remove the plastic wrap, slash the loaf as desired, and bake at 350 degrees until nicely browned, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool completely on a rack before slicing.

Cook the Book: Maharashtran Lamb Curry

When choosing Anjum Anand 's Anjum's New Indian for this week's Cook the Book, I had my heart set on her wonderful winter curries.  Rich and saucy, they warm you through their heat with all those layers of spices. This Maharashtran Lamb Curry was exactly what I was hoping for.
This really lamby curry is a sweet-savory-sour mix of coconut, caramelized onions, tamarind, and a blend of spices known as Black Masala .  Sometimes referred to as Goda Masala , it combines a laundry list of spices as well as ground, toasted coconut and sesame seeds.  The sweetness of the coconut and the sour tamarind paste make a gorgeous, rich sauce to coat the lamb chunks.
While the recipe calls for lamb neck filet, a cut that can be cooked quickly, I chose to go with lamb stew meat.  The stew meat required additional cooking time, about an hour of simmering, and cooked down in the sauce to fork-tender deliciousness.
As always with our Cook the Book feature, we have five (5) copies of Anjum's New Inidan to give away this week.
Adapted from Anjum's New Indian . Copyright © 2010. Published by WIley. Available wherever books are sold.  All Rights Reserved.
Ingredients serves 4 to 6
1 1/4 inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled
5 large cloves of garlic, peeled
4 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 medium onion, peeled and chopped
2 teaspoons white poppy seeds
1/3 cup unsweetened dried coconut flakes
1 pound lamb, neck fillet, cut into 1in pieces
Salt, to taste
1/2 teaspoon pure red chile powder, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala
3 to 4 teaspoons black masala powder, or to taste
8 tablespoons coconut milk, or to taste
1 to 1 1/4 teaspoons tamarind paste, or to taste
Handful of fresh cilantro leaves to garnish 
Procedures
1
Using a blender, make a smooth paste of the ginger and garlic with a little water.
2
Heat the oil in a nonstick saucepan, add the onion and cook until golden. Remove half and reserve. Add the poppy seeds and unsweetened dried coconut flakes to the pan and continue cooking until golden. Scrape into a blender and blend to a fine paste, adding a little water to help, then set aside.
3
Spoon the reserved onions back into the pan, reheat and add the ginger and garlic paste. Cook until golden brown, around 2–3 minutes. Add the lamb and brown evenly, stirring often, around 4 minutes. Stir in the salt and spices and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly.
4
Add the coconut milk, tamarind paste and the onion and poppy seed paste along with a good splash of water. Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for 5 minutes. The gravy should be creamy, not too thick or thin. Taste and adjust the seasoning, stir in the cilantro and serve.

Rack of Lamb with Mustard-Shallot Sauce ACTIVE: 15 MIN
TOTAL TIME: 45 MIN
SERVINGS: 2
FAST
STAFF-FAVORITE
Ingredients 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
One 2 1/2-pound frenched rack of lamb
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 medium shallots, thinly sliced
1/4 cup dry white wine
1/4 cup chicken stock or low-sodium broth
1 tablespoon whole grain mustard
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons chopped thyme
Directions Preheat the oven to 400°. In a medium skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Season the lamb with salt and pepper. Add the lamb to the skillet, fat side down, and cook over moderately high heat until richly browned, about 3 minutes. Turn the lamb fat side up and cook for 2 minutes longer. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the rack for about 20 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the meat registers 125° for medium-rare. Transfer the lamb to a carving board and let rest for 10 minutes.
Discard the fat in the skillet. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil and the shallots to the skillet and cook over moderate heat until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the wine and simmer until reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Add the stock and bring to a simmer. Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the whole grain and Dijon mustards and the thyme. Season the sauce with salt and pepper.
Carve the lamb into chops and arrange on warmed plates. Spoon the sauce over the lamb and serve.

Scallops with Brussels Sprouts Recipe by Stuart Brioza and Nicole Krasinski

Stuart Brioza has a brilliant way of preparing brussels sprouts: Rather than cook them whole, he thinly slices them, then sautés them with pancetta, shallot and garlic until they're shredded and soft.

Scallops with Brussels Sprouts TOTAL TIME: 25 MIN
SERVINGS: 2
FAST
Ingredients 1/4 cup crème fraîche
1/4 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon snipped chives
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Salt and freshly ground pepper
6 jumbo scallops (about 3/4 pound)
6 thin slices pancetta (about 2 ounces)
1/2 pound brussels sprouts, thinly sliced
1 shallot, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 garlic clove, minced
Directions In a small bowl, whisk the crème fraîche with the finely grated lemon zest, fresh lemon juice, snipped chives and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Season the lemon-chive crème fraîche with salt and pepper.
In a medium skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil until shimmering. Generously season the scallops with salt and pepper and add them to the skillet. Cook the scallops over moderately high heat, turning once, until they are golden and just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer the scallops to a plate; tent with aluminum foil to keep warm.
Meanwhile, in another medium skillet, cook the pancetta over moderately high heat, turning once, until browned and crisp, about 4 minutes. Add the brussels sprouts and shallot and cook, stirring, until the brussels sprouts are softened but still bright green, about 2 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the butter and garlic and season with salt and pepper; transfer to plates and top with the scallops. Serve with the lemon-chive crème fraîche.

Molten Chocolate Cakes Recipe by Jean-Georges Vongerichten
Rate & Review
It seems as though every restaurant in America offers a version of this amazing cake created by master chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten . But his supremely rich and chocolaty original is in a class by itself.
See our wine pairings below
Pairing Suggestion Chocolate is too intense and bitter for many sweet wines, but not port. Try this dessert with a Ruby Porto.

Molten Chocolate Cakes ACTIVE: 20 MIN
TOTAL TIME: 35 MIN
SERVINGS: MAKES FOUR 6-OUNCE CAKES
FAST
STAFF-FAVORITE
Ingredients 1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter
6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, preferably Valrhona
2 eggs
2 egg yolks
1/4 cup sugar
Pinch of salt
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
Directions Preheat the oven to 450°. Butter and lightly flour four 6-ounce ramekins. Tap out the excess flour. Set the ramekins on a baking sheet.
In a double boiler, over simmering water, melt the butter with the chocolate. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the egg yolks, sugar and salt at high speed until thickened and pale.
Whisk the chocolate until smooth. Quickly fold it into the egg mixture along with the flour. Spoon the batter into the prepared ramekins and bake for 12 minutes, or until the sides of the cakes are firm but the centers are soft. Let the cakes cool in the ramekins for 1 minute, then cover each with an inverted dessert plate. Carefully turn each one over, let stand for 10 seconds and then unmold. Serve immediately.
Make Ahead The batter can be refrigerated for several hours; bring to room temperature before baking.

FAST
MAKE-AHEAD
VEGETARIAN
Ingredients 1/4 cup milk
3 tablespoons sugar
1 large egg yolk
3 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped, plus shaved chocolate, for serving
Pinch of salt
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup heavy cream
Pinch of ground cinnamon
Directions In a small saucepan, combine the milk and 2 tablespoons of the sugar and heat until steaming and the sugar is dissolved.

Off the heat, add the chopped chocolate and salt and whisk until smooth. Whisk in the butter. Pour the custard into 2 shallow bowls and refrigerate briefly, about 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, beat the heavy cream with the cinnamon and the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar until softly whipped. Dollop the cream on the custards, sprinkle the chocolate shavings on the cream and serve.
Make Ahead The chocolate custards can be prepared through Step 2 and refrigerated overnight. Serve the custards chilled or at room temperature.

This was good and flavorful.  I didn't have lemon so I used lime juice instead.  Still very good.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

Superb recipe! Instead of grilling, I added about a few dashes of liquid smoke. It freezes well, so make a double batch.

My husband absolutely loved this! I liked it, just not quite as much as him.  I had never had this before so maybe it just takes some getting used to.  We used the food processor for the eggplant and then stirred the rest of the ingredients in by hand.  My only question is, was I suppose to leave the seeds in?

OH.  MY.  GOD.  This is possibly the best baba ghanoush I've ever had.  I made this with eggplants fresh from my garden and it came out fantastic!  I was going to keep the skins on but I'm glad I didn't.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it came out so light and fluffy and absolutely delicious.  the only thing I did differently was I blended it all in the food processor.  Thanks!!!

I made this using eggplants from my garden, which are a long skinny variety.  I thought 2 would equal 1 egg-shaped eggplant but obviously didn't because my baba ghanoush came out rather runny and REALLY lemony.  I really don't mind though because I still think it tastes great!  However, I would like it to be thicker so I might run to the store tomorrow and buy another eggplant to add to it.  Still a great recipe though and I can't imagine how good it will be with the right amount of eggplant!  Thanks for sharing!!

My first attempt at Baba Ghanoush and it is awesome.  I accidentally mixed in the olive oil, but it is still great. I am already looking fwd to my next trip to the produce stand to get another eggplant.

Great salad for lunches.  Used whole wheat shell pasta, skipped the bell pepper since didn't have one.  Have made it twice and it's very satisfying and refreshing on hot days.  Cheap too!

This was a wonderful pasta salad. I doubled the recipe and added about 1/4 c fresh chopped dill. Perfect! I made this for a neighbor who is ill, and she loved it. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Really easy quick fix for lunch. I didn't have any celery/bell peppers on hand but I did add some peas to the mix. Also needed a little something so put in some mustard and sweet relish. Yummy dish!!

A good 4 1/2 stars. This was quick. Not something I would serve to company but tasty for lunch. I used rice pasta macaroni to be gluten free. I cooked my eggs up using Recipe #173837. Replaced the vidalia onions with red onion as that is what I had on hand. I did not add bell peppers per preference and think I used less Hellmans olive oil mayonnaise to be soy free. I used lots of pepper and some sea salt.

This is fabulous!  I'm not that big of a fan of tuna salad sandwiches either, but I loved this! I was needing something fast to make and my pantry was getting pretty low so when I stumbled upon this recipe, I tried it, thinking that I would not care for this, but it will feed the others in the house.  Boy was I wrong!  We all chowed down!  This recipe will always be in my back pocket for when I need something fast with minimal ingredients.  I only used 1 egg (next time I will use 2), few dashes of celery salt instead of celery since I was out, no peppers (I was out) and 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup Miracle Whip (because I was running low on both)  Can you tell I need to go to the store?  With all these changes, I give you all the credit as I don't think the taste would alter drastically enough for me to change my rating.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Hey guess what, this works with angel hair pasta too, I broke the pasta into quarter lengths. I used half a box of 450g, and two tins of tuna. I also added half a red bell pepper, maybe a quarter of a red onion, 2 hard boiled eggs, and a few sweet gherkins. Maybe it's just because I LOVE gherkins, but the sweetness went so well with this. Next time I'll experiment with some spices. THANK YOU!

I gave this 5 stars. I love this recipe! My gram taught me how to make it. The copy I got from her is slightly different. There is no green pepper or celery listed (I have had it with celery in it before). It calls for 1/2 box Ring pasta (P&G or Ronzoni, Salad Supreme (Opt, we always add this to the salad and on top), celery salt (Opt), and green olives (Opt). My gram would sometimes use part salad dressing & a little sugar. The rest of the recipe is the same as posted. To bump up the protein in this salad I've used a 12oz can of tuna and 4 hard-boiled eggs and the flavor was not changed what so ever. Thanks for posting a great recipe! Christine (internetnut)

I thought that the amount of vegetables in this was wonderful, especially using red onion. I got complaints about the onion (but I liked it). I also made some changes that were not well received.. I used solid albacore tuna, which was deemed "too fishy." I also used mostly whole wheat pasta which we decided we did not like. We just used the salt and pepper at the table since I couldn't figure out how much would be enough for the dish. I doubled the recipe for 4 servings, but actually I think the regular recipe would be fine to serve 4. I used the larger amount of eggs and chopped them rather than mashing them.

A tasty tuna salad which is easy to prepare. I frequently make it during the Summer for a light supper, after a day at the pool. Also works well for picnics. Amounts given are estimates, I usually prepare this "by taste".

Recipe #448809
This is a very popular Vietnamese fast-food-style dish but unlike Western fast-food it's slightly more healthy... (esp. if you skip the spring rolls and use bbq meat instead)
If you don't want to cook spring rolls, you can use Thai fish cakes, grilled pork/beef/chicken, prawns or tofu.  Pretty much any protein at all.  Or you can just eat the noodles and salad on their own.
In my photo I have used home made fish cakes instead of spring rolls, but I think spring rolls makes the tastiest version of this recipe.
You will have a lot of extra spring rolls!  You can freeze them without cooking them for later if you want.

Ingredients: Servings:
4 4
4 large potatoes (russet, yellow gold, white or red potatoes)
your choice 
			spices			
			 (granulated garlic powder, seasoning salt, cayenne pepper, dried dill weed, granulated garlic powder)
vegetable oil, for microwave bacon tray
Change Measurements : US | Metric
Directions: Prep Time: 10 mins
Total Time: 35 mins
1 If potatoes are old, peel and slice thin, less than 1/16" in thickness (paper thin), slicing across the potato.
2 If the potatoes are new or good skins, DO NOT PEEL, just scrub well, then slice them less than 1/16" in thickness (paper thin), slicing across the potato.
3 Place potato slices in a bowl, sprinkle with some salt (if desired) cover with cold water and let sit for 10 minutes.
4 Remove potato slices in batches onto paper toweling and pat dry.
5 If you have a microwave bacon tray, rub the tray with a vegetable oil, then place the sliced potatoes flat on the tray in a single layer.
6 Sprinkle with your choice of herbs or spices or just leave them plain.
7 Cover with a microwaveable, round heavy plastic cover.
8 Microwave on HIGH (full power) for 5 to 5 1/2 minutes or until they curl slightly and are a very light brown in color.
9 Cooking time could vary slightly, depending on the wattage of your microwave and the thickness of the slices.  The thinner the slices, the quicker they cook and the tastier they are.
10 You do not have to turn the sliced potatoes over.
11 If you do not have a bacon tray, use a microwave safe casserole dish.
12 Rub the inside of the dish with some olive oil for the first batch of potato chips.
13 I do not know why, but I find that if you do not rub oil the first time, some chips will tend to stick to the dish.
14 After the first batch is done, you do not have to rub the dish again.
15 Continue to microwave the remainder of sliced potatoes as noted above.
16 If using a bacon tray, after the first batch is cooked, you can reduce the microwaving time to 4 1/2 minutes and even less as you continue to microwave each batch.
17 NOTE:  You can also use PARCHMENT PAPER to microwave the potato slices.  Lightly spray or rub the parchment paper with some vegetable oil or a Pam spray. Place your potato slices on the parchment paper, then sprinkle them with whatever you like and then place another piece of parchment paper on top.  This will help microwave the  potatoes more evenly and they should turn out nice and crisp.  Microwaving time should be between 5 and 6 minutes.
18 ADDITIONAL IDEAS, suggested by Deb K:.
19 Granulated garlic powder with parsley.
20 Cracked black pepper, grated parmesan and sea salt sprinkled after removing from microwave.
21 Another, after removing chips from microwave, sprinkle with grated cheddar cheese, zap for a few seconds to melt the cheese, then add a dab of sour cream.
22 A great dip is Robert Rothschild Farm Dips:.
23 Emerald Isle Onion Dill and Horseradish Dip.

One potato done it two batches.  I cut them so paper-thin and they came out very crispy.  I soaked them in salted water and then tasting them I added a little sea salt to them.  I will make them again.  Personally, the commercial chips make me physically ill from the oil so these were a big improvement.  I am going to make them for DH as he is the chip lover in the family.  BTW. I just sprayed a plate with Pam and didn't cover them.  Thanks Bill!!!

Although I haven't tried this as yet I have been involved in developing large microwave potato manufacturing. The dark areas is typically concetrations of sugar especially in older chips. You might try getting your hands on chipper potatoes which are low in natural sugar.

Thank you, Uncle Bill! Easy, yummy and healthy!  I also have a small microwave, so I could only make small batches at a time.  I plan to experiment with different flavors: a little BBQ sauce brushed on and some salt & vinegar.  I think it will take my a little time to perfect the cooking time needed for my appliance.  I found some to be a little on the chewy side.  Most, however tasted just like you think a potato chip should-- but better!

As if you need another 5-star review.  Thanks from one more fan for these delicious, easy, and healthy alternative to bagged chips.  My husband, who hates healthy food, loved them.  I think we found our next healthy snack... THANK YOU SOO MUCH.  Also, to future readers all I have to say is that you have to find your microwave oven's sweet spot.  Mine was 7.5 minutes on parchment paper.  It takes a bit of experimentation, just keep an eye on them so they don't burn.  Mine came out perfect on try one :)

I made a batch of these potato chips yesterday using the parchment paper method.  I took a sheet of parchment paper, folded it in half, then opened it up again and sprayed the whole sheet with Pam.  Sprinkled the sheet with Kosher salt and then placed the sliced potatoes on one side of the fold.  Then folded the other side over the chips and (using a cookie sheet) put the folded packet into the microwave oven.  I had to cook it for about 9 minutes to get them crisp.  None of the chips stuck to either the top or bottom paper.  The chips were wonderful.  Probably going to do a bach again tonight.  I can't wait until the grandkids come over.

these taste delish! I did encounter some probs as well, similar to others...I don't have a bacon tray, so I tried the flat dish, but I didn't have a proper lid, so the chips took too long to cook. I decided to try the parchment paper.  This worked better, but I had to spray both bottom sheet and the covering top sheet, and still got some sticking.  Took over 9 min in our microwave. I was surprised as I thought our mic was powerful.  As I progressed, each batch turned out better than the last.  great tasting recipe..time consuming though, unless you have a huge microwave...or 5 of them! Thanks Uncie

This is in my "who'd a thunk it" category! We loved the chips and even added a little Mrs. Dash for extra flavor - minus the salt. Wow! It's a real keeper, so thanks for sharing the recipe. Uncle Bill has done it again - a wondeerful recipe with very explicit (wonderful) directions! Thanks! XX

These were so yummy and very easy. I will be making these quite often. I sprinkled dill pickle popcorn seasoning on these and they tasted much better then the dill pickle chips I usualy buy.

Not, that you need anymore reviews, but thought I would add to the love fest! :-)  What a great healthy way to have potato chips.  I cooked them on parchment paper sprayed with olive oil pam.  The first batch I sprinkled sea salt, garlic powder and cayenne pepper on the potatoes.  The next batch I used just sea salt and cayenne pepper.  I liked the first batch a lot more.  The garlic added a nice flavor! Maybe next time I will try them with onion powder......

These are really good. I save 5 stars for recipes that knock my socks off. They did take longer to crisp up for me. It seemed that my microwave just steamed off so much liquid. It is definatly a good thing. And will be very handy for when I want a quick snack so I will not consume quick to eat sugars.

These potato chips are very easy to make in the microwave. Also, they are healthier for you as they are not cooked in any oils. This method has intrigued so many people that have tasted them and then made them for themselves. The younger people just love them.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that this came out just as good as the fried rice I get at my favorite local Thai restaurant.

I followed the recipe in terms of ingredients, but here are a few extra things I did:

I pounded my chicken breasts flat, cut them up into strips, and quickly stir fried them in a little olive oil and just a pinch of salt. Once they were almost cooked through, I splashed on a little bit of soy sauce and set them aside. 

I cooked my sliced onions in the butter, (instead of the eggs. I used PAM for those) Great flavor and gave the rice a little something too.

When I combined all ingredients, I also added some green onion to this dish, red pepper, and red pepper flakes.

Also! *Make sure your rice is cold when you cook this!*

GREAT recipe, will use again and again. Thanks! Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

Love this one! I used thawed frozen mixed vegis and added them after everything. Made for a very quick and easy recipe. 

I do recommend that you have everything chopped and ready to add before you actually start cooking as this cooks very quickly and leaves no time in between.

My 3yo loves fried rice when we are out so this was an excellent dinner for her! And I could chop the vegis and chicken into bite sizes for her and not worry about her trying to stuff something too big into her mouth! And the rest of the family loves it just as well, even my super picky husband (who seems to never eat anythign I make! LOL) Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

This is one of those recipes you can easily tweek to your own tastes.  I added peas and green onions at the end with the egg.  Only used 1/2 of the pepper called for & used seasme oil instead of the veg. oil.  Thought it made a very good side.  Will make again! Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

This needed some alteration, but turned out great.  And bear in mind it's a lot of work and requires significant chopping.  I added green onion and chopped ed pepper, as well as teriyaki sauce.  I also added some red pepper flakes for spice.  And at the last minute, I added some pineapple and pineapple juice and cashews for a special treat.  My boyfriend loved it!  It made a lot.

This was a very tasty and simple recipe.  I added some chopped up garlic to the onions as I sauteed them.  Also I recommend using A LOT less pepper as it is VERY spicy if you don't.  You really don't have to put any pepper in if you don't want to.  It's quite flavorful without it. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

So easy.  I found that the moisture from rinsing the greens was ample to cook the greens.

After cooking the bacon (and removing half of the grease) I placed the greens into the skillet with the other ingredients and simmered until tender. I served these on new years day with  "slow cooker spicy black-eyed peas" submited by MJ46NY. A delicious combination. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

This is a GREAT, simple recipe! In fact, I made my New Year's greens last year using this recipe and, when I wanted to make them again this year, realized I had lost the recipe! Thankfully, I've found it and will keep it this time. As one of the true "GRITS" (Girls Raised in the South), I can honestly say this is one of the best recipes for good Southern-style greens I've found! :) Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

I used a 16oz bag of frozen turnip greens in place of the bunch of collards.  The other change I made was to add 2 packets of splenda to try and counteract the bitterness frozen greens tend to have.  Really really yummy.  Will use this for the rest of the greens in my freezer! Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

I too have southern back ground and we have always put some sort of pork in with the collard's, but what make's this recipe so good and different is the chicken stock. Plain water just doesn't cut it for me any more... I used a mild hot sauce because of the pepper and it was just great. Thanks for the gift. nan Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

Hearty Creole Okra and Tomatoes
By: wasabinoir  
"A great Southern okra dish that allegedly comes from the heart of Acadiana.  This vegetable dish is heavy enough to serve as a main dish and makes one pine for the fiddles and chicory coffee."

Original Recipe Yield 12 servings  
Ingredients 2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 stalks celery, chopped
2 onions, chopped
4 ears fresh corn, shucked and kernels scraped from cob
2 pounds fresh okra, cut into 1/2 inch slices
2 (28 ounce) cans whole tomatoes, broken up
1/2 pound andouille sausage, diced
1/2 teaspoon Creole seasoning, or to taste
sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
Directions Heat butter and olive oil over medium heat in a large pot.  Cook and stir celery and onions until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the corn kernels and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in okra, tomatoes, andouille sausage, and Creole seasoning; cover and cook over medium heat until the okra has lost all of its slippery texture, at least 45 minutes. Season with sea salt, black pepper, and more Creole seasoning if necessary. Cook, uncovered, to reduce liquid, about 10 minutes.

A version of this has long been a family favorite. If you don't have the sausage, brown 1/2 to 1 lb of ground beef and add it along with 1-2 cups of cooked elbow macaroni. It will become an entire dish even without the meat. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

Yumm  A++ This is a great recipe to use up those garden veggies!  I cut the recipe in half because there's only 2 of us.  I added a couple of jalepenos and 1/2 of water plus all listed ingredients in a crockpot and let it simmer for a few hours. Thank you wasabinoir! PS: make some cornbread to go along with it!! Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

This is always been one of my favorite pasta dishes.  I used pancetta instead of bacon, cooking the pancetta in olive oil until lightly crisp.  I added another 1/4 cup of Parmesan to the dish and a pinch of salt to the cream to heighten the flavors.  Some sauted crimni mushrooms rounded out the dish. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

2 pounds cleaned squid
Heaping 1/3 cup niçoise olives, finely chopped

Preparation Rinse squid under cold running water, then pat dry between paper towels. Halve tentacles lengthwise and cut bodies (including flaps, if attached) crosswise into 1/8-inch-wide rings. Cook in a 4-quart pot of boiling salted water (1 tablespoon salt for 3 quarts water), uncovered, until just opaque, 30 to 40 seconds. Drain and immediately transfer to an ice bath to stop cooking. When squid is cool, drain and pat dry.
Meanwhile, combine remaining ingredients and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Add squid and toss until combined well. Serve chilled or at room temperature.

This was very good. I used it as a veggie dish for dinner. I made one change -  I added a small amount of fresh minced garlic. When I make it again, which I will, I am going to top them with a bread crumb topping. I think that will add a great crunch and texture. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

I used fat free ricotta and also added fresh garlic and sprinkled Italian breadcrumbs on top. I think the flavor was good, but next time I will add more seasonings and maybe some chopped tomatoes. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

What a great way to eat zucchini!  We gobbled this recipe up and I will be making it again.  Slightly reduced the amount of salt and put in a bit more dried basil than it called for ... fantastic, thanks for sharing! Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

Ingredients 2 tablespoons olive oil
2 stalks celery , cut into bite-size pieces
1 carrot, peeled, cut into bite-size pieces
1 small onion , chopped
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 (14 1/2-ounce) can chopped tomatoes
1 (14-ounce) can low-salt chicken broth
1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, torn into pieces
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
2 chicken breast with ribs (about 1 1/2 pounds total)
1 (15-ounce) can organic kidney beans , drained (rinsed if not organic)
Serving suggestion: crusty bread
Directions Heat the oil in a heavy 5 1/2-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add the celery, carrot , and onion. Saute the vegetables until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in the tomatoes with their juices, chicken broth , basil, tomato paste, bay leaf , and thyme. Add the chicken breasts; press to submerge.
Bring the cooking liquid to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer gently uncovered until the chicken is almost cooked through, turning the chicken breasts over and stirring the mixture occasionally, about 25 minutes. Using tongs, transfer the chicken breasts to a work surface and cool for 5 minutes. Discard the bay leaf. Add the kidney beans to the pot and simmer until the liquid has reduced into a stew consistency, about 10 minutes.
Discard the skin and bones from the chicken breasts. Shred or cut the chicken into bite- size pieces. Return the chicken meat to the stew. Bring the stew just to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Ladle the stew into serving bowls and serve with the bread.

I liked this soup. I believe it could have used less chicken than I put in it, however, my husband said that there could never be enough chicken. The crusty bread was a great complement to the stew.

Great! I made slight modifications. I doubled the recipe and used white kidney beans, black beans and a can of corn. To make life easier, I used boneless, skinless chicken with rib meat and it was just fine and so much easier. Enjoy!

Ingredients 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 teaspoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
1 teaspoon kosher salt , plus extra for seasoning chicken
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus extra for seasoning chicken
4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
2 large whole eggs , beaten with 1 teaspoon water
2 cups Japanese bread crumbs ( panko ), plus 1/4 cup for filling
Vegetable oil, for frying
Directions Combine butter, parsley, tarragon, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in the bowl of a stand mixer . Place mixture on plastic wrap or waxed paper and roll into small log; place in freezer.
Place chicken breasts, 1 at a time, between 2 pieces of plastic wrap . Squirt chicken lightly with water and squirt the top of the plastic wrap as well. Pound to no less than 1/8-inch thickness. Season each piece of chicken with salt and pepper.
Lay 1 chicken breast on a new piece of plastic wrap and place 1/4 of the compound butter and 1 tablespoon bread crumbs in the center of each breast. Using the plastic wrap to assist, fold in ends of breast and roll breast into a log, completely enclosing the butter; roll very tightly. Repeat with each breast. Place chicken in refrigerator for 2 hours, or up to overnight.
Place egg and water mixture in 1 pie pan and 2 cups bread crumbs in a different pie pan.
Heat 1/2-inch of vegetable oil in a 12-inch saute pan over medium-high heat until oil reaches 375 degrees F.
Dip each breast in the egg mixture and then roll in the bread crumbs. Gently place each breast in oil, sealed-side down, and cook until golden brown, approximately 4 to 5 minutes on each side, until the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Remove to a cooling rack set in sheet pan and allow to drain for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

This was terrific.  I like cooking with tarragon (especially when it's fresh from my herb garden.  The only thing I changed was that I used the Kellogg's corn flakes crumbs.  I can not find the flakes that are already crumbed up for you so I made my own with a box of the cereal.  Put it in the processing and "wa la".  I deep fried them for 5 to 8 minutes depending on the size of the cutlet.  It was delicious......Thanks Alton

Amazing chicken kiev. I've tried many kiev recipes and this one is by far the best. I don't care for tarragon, so I replaced it with other herbs, but that's the only change I made.
I heartily recommend this recipe to...well, anyone who isn't a vegetarian.

This is another one of those go-to recipes.  Print it out and keep it - make whatever variations you want, but the original is incredible!

Directions Bobby's Perfect Patty
Shape 6 ounces of 80 percent lean ground beef chuck into a uniform patty, no more than 3/4 inch thick (don't overwork the meat). Make a depression in the center with your thumb so the burger won't bulge; the indent will rise as the patty cooks. Preheat a grill or cast-iron grill pan to high. Brush the burger with canola oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill until golden brown and slightly charred, turning once (7 minutes for medium-rare). Avoid pressing with a spatula ! Add cheese for the last minute of cooking.
Cheese
Your pick: Monterey Jack is a California favorite, but Bobby loves this burger with cheddar , too.
Avocado Relish
Avocado is one of Bobby's favorite ingredients. He mixes 2 chopped Hass avocados with 1/2 diced small onion, 1 minced jalapeno, the juice of 1 lime, 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro , and salt and pepper.
Watercress
L.A. doesn't do iceberg lettuce, so Bobby tops off the burger with this peppery green instead.
Tomato
One thick, juicy slice takes the place of ketchup.

Another winner from BFlay.  In New England, I have a ton of Romaine lettuce, so I used that.  I used sharp cheddar instead of Monterey. And I used Alton Browns guacamole (by far the best for the topping.  Sorry, BFlay.  The family loved this burger and that is all the matters.  I will make this again. Thanks for sharing, Flay ..

All summer made Saturday a new hamburger day. My family and my sons friends come over to try the new burgers. This has been one of the favorites and the requested last Saturday hamburger before they leave for college. Thanks for the great hamburger choices that made this summer enjoyable and family and friends close.

Ingredients Cheesecake: 1 1/3 cups graham cracker crumbs (from approximately 12 graham crackers)
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup butter, melted
3 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, softened
1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin
3 large eggs, at room temperature for 30 minutes
1/4 cup pure grade B maple syrup
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
Maple Pecan Glaze : 1 cup whipping cream
3/4 cup pure grade B maple syrup
3/4 cup chopped pecans
Directions Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
For the cheesecake: Finely crush the graham crackers in a plastic bag with a rolling pin or use a food processor . In a large bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter and firmly press into the bottom of 9-inch springform pan.
In a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, mix the cream cheese until fluffy. Gradually mix in the sweetened condensed milk until smooth. With the mixer on medium, add the pumpkin, eggs, maple syrup, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Mix well and pour into the springform pan .
Bake until the center appears nearly set, but jiggles a little when shaken, 1 hour and 15 minutes. Cool for 1 hour. Cover and chill overnight, or for at least 4 hours.
For the glaze: In a medium-sized saucepan , combine the whipping cream and pure maple syrup and bring it to a boil. Boil until slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the chopped pecans. Cover and chill until time to serve. Stir before serving.
To serve: Spoon the Maple Pecan Glaze over the cheesecake

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! Will be making it again for another holiday party. I used a 11" pan and it worked perfectly! It was sooo easy to make!

I made this for Christmas Day and it was an incredible hit !!!  My only modification (based on a previous review was to make it in a 10 inch pan rather than a 9 inch.  No leftovers.  A to die for cheesecake and easy to make.  Thank you Anne

Ingredients 2 tablespoons kosher salted butter
1 shallot, minced
8 ounces lobster meat (tail, knuckles and claws), poached and roughly chopped
1/4 cup green asparagus , blanched and sliced on a bias
4 large eggs
2 tablespoons chopped parsley
2 tablespoons minced chives
Kosher salt
Black pepper
8 ounces Oyster Cava cream
8 French baguette slices, toasted
Oyster Cava Cream: 5 shallots, minced
4 cloves garlic , crushed
3 cups Cava
1 quart heavy cream
2 tablespoons minced chives
Kosher salt
4 Raspberry Point oysters, shucked with liquor saved
Directions In a medium saucepot sweat the shallots and garlic until translucent. Add Cava and reduce to 1 cup. Add the heavy cream, and bring to a low boil. Reduce heat and simmer cream until nap stage (thick enough to coat the back of a spoon). Cool for about 5 minutes. Puree cream in a blender and pass through a chinois . Season with kosher salt, to taste. Store cream refrigerated in a sealed plastic container for up to 3 days.
Just before serving, reheat cream in a small sauce pot, adding additional heavy cream to return sauce to nap stage. Add shucked oysters, including oyster liquor, and gently poach oysters in cream. Add chives and reseason with kosher salt, to taste.
Putting it all together:
Heat a nonstick saute pan over medium-low heat. Add butter and heat until it no longer bubbles. Add shallot , lobster and green asparagus and gently warm through. Meanwhile, crack eggs into a small mixing bowl and whisk until frothy . Incorporate parsley and chives, and season, to taste, with kosher salt and black pepper. Add eggs to saute pan and gently scramble eggs until just barely cooked.
On a 10-inch plate, pour eggs into a 5-inch diameter ring mold and fold the lobster mixture in. Mixture should be very soft. Garnish with toast and oyster cava cream.

I am very happy that you are an IRON CHEF and you are. I live in Utah and me and my family went all the way to Philly just to go to
AMADA, but it was allready closed for lunch when we got there. Then we decided to come back for dinner and we come back to late so we could not enjoy your delicious food. I had watched all your challenges and I see how you use the ingredients Iam proud of you!
!!! CONGRATULATIONS !!!
BIG FAN

This is one of the few recipies I would have preferred to have phots and/or a video. I don't use much dairy when I cook because family members are Lactose intolerant. (They sometimes get upset because I can eat almost anything! LOL But this sounds great and I will try it when  others visit and we have several dishes - as we usually do when company comes.
I have tried Chef Garces other recipies and love what he brings to the world of cooking!

Roasted Parsnips and Sweet Potatoes with Honey-Pecan Drizzle Serves 6 to 8 This side dish of roasted sweet root vegetables is a perfect accompaniment to roasted chicken or pork tenderloin. A side of bitter greens, like mustard greens, offers a nice balance to the sweetness.
Ingredients 2 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
2 pounds parsnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
1 bay leaf
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
1 cup orange juice
1/3 cup honey
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 cup pecans, toasted and chopped
1/4 cup chopped parsley
Method Preheat oven to 400°F. In a large bowl, toss together sweet potatoes, parsnips, bay leaf, oil and salt and pepper and then transfer to a large roasting pan. Roast, stirring occasionally, until tender and golden brown, about 1 hour; discard bay leaf. Meanwhile, whisk together juice, honey and sugar in a medium saucepan and  bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until reduced and thickened, 7 to 8 minutes. Stir in pecans and set aside.
Transfer vegetables to a platter, drizzle honey-pecan mixture over the top, garnish with parsley and serve.

Heirloom Tomato BLTs Serve 4 Colorful, flavorful heirloom tomatoes star in these classic sandwiches. Also try making a BLT salad: stir the mayonnaise and pesto into 2 tablespoons of your favorite vinaigrette, then toss with lots of chopped lettuce, tomatoes, crumbled bacon or tempeh, and homemade croutons.
Ingredients 8 slices whole-grain sandwich bread, grilled or toasted
2 tablespoons mayonnaise or vegan mayonnaise
1 tablespoon prepared pesto or vegan pesto (optional)
1 pound assorted heirloom tomatoes (2 to 3), sliced
Finishing salt, such as fleur de sel or Maldon
8 ounces bacon, cooked crisp, or tempeh bacon strips, cooked according to package instructions
1 cup chopped lettuce
Method Lay bread out on a work surface. Combine mayonnaise and pesto; spread evenly over one side of each bread slice. Sprinkle tomatoes with salt and layer onto half the bread slices. Top tomatoes with bacon and lettuce, and cover with remaining bread slices. Cut each sandwich in half on the diagonal and pile onto a platter.

Carrot and Fennel Soup Recipe November 28, 2010    |   117 Comments Before I share the recipe for the soup I enjoyed for lunch today, I feel compelled to tell you something about myself. Here goes. I'm the sort of person who owns one umbrella. One umbrella I really like, instead of four umbrellas I sort-of like. It's a tendency that carries over into other areas of my life (books and magazines aside) and it works out nicely because our apartment isn't particularly large. But it's raining today, and I'm sitting here next to the window, lovely bowl of soup in front of me, thinking about my favorite umbrella . Midnight blue adorned with tiny, pin-point white dots, it has scalloped edges and folds down to a size that can usually be accommodated by my bag. It braves a strong wind with confidence, and guides rivulets of water out past my shoulders before letting them drop - keeping me dry in the process. I bought it at a Muji store in Tokyo, and thoroughly enjoyed having it as my rainy day partner. It went with me to France. It went with me to Spain. And then, a few months back, it went with me to Tartine - the sun broke through, we sat outside, visited with a few friends, had a few treats, and when I walked away from the table I must have left it hooked to the back of my chair. My hope is that someone found it, took it home, and now likes it as much as I did. I think about it on days like today, I somehow can't help it. I've tried three umbrellas since I lost the Muji, and quite frankly, rainy days aren't quite the same.
The soup? I riffed on a recipe from The Essential New York Times Cookbook . I often crave clean, simple meals in between all the holiday decadence, and there was a carrot & fennel soup in Amanda's book that sounded just right. It's simple, brothy, and the perfect way to use up a bunch of bushy-topped farmers' market carrots. I added wild rice, but you could use another grain if you like. Or omit he wild rice altogether - it isn't in the original recipe. I also had a vibrant blood orange olive oil on hand, so I used that to add a citrusy accent to this soup, you can certainly use fresh orange juice instead. And, as I mention below, you can top with a poached egg and have a one-dish meal on your hands. I hope all of you here in the U.S. enjoyed the long weekend and were able to spend it with lots of friends and family around. -h
Carrot and Fennel Soup Like I mention up above - it's easy to make a meal of this by serving it topped with a poached egg. Alternately, you can make this soup vegan by omitting the Parmesan.
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 medium fennel bulbs, trimmed fronds reserved, thinly sliced
2 1/4 pounds / 36 ounces farmer market carrots, thickly sliced
2 large cloves garlic, thinly sliced
10 cups good-tasting vegetable broth or water
salt to taste
3 cups / 12 oz cooked wild rice
2 tablespoons blood orange olive oil or 5 tablespoons fresh orange juice
lots of freshly grated Parmesan cheese
Heat the olive oil in your largest soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the fennel and cook for 3-4 minutes, until softened a bit. Stir in the carrots and cook another 10 minutes, just long enough for them to soften a touch and start taking on a bit of color. Stir in the garlic and cook another 30 seconds. Stir in the broth. Bring to a simmer and simmer, covered, until the carrots are very tender, another 15-20 minutes or so. Stir in the wild rice, bring back to a simmer, taste and add more salt if needed
Remove from heat and stir in the blood orange olive oil or orange juice. Taste and add more if needed. Serve dusted, generously, with freshly grated Parmesan, and a sprinkling of the reserved fennel fronds.
Serves about 6.
Inspired by the Carrot & Fennel Soup in The Essential New York Times Cookbook by Amanda Hesser.

Inspired by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's soda bread recipe, this version is made with a blend of spelt flour and all-purpose flour.

It bakes into a perfect, rustic, crusty loaf of bread with relatively little effort.

Warm, coin-shaped slices of pan-fried carrots, white alubia beans, and chopped dill tossed with a tangy-sweet lemon shallot dressing. It tastes good the day you make it, even better the day after.

Baked Farro Risotto Recipe February 14, 2011    |   100 Comments Here's something I don't think I've ever mentioned. And it may sound a bit strange. We have heat here in our apartment, we might even have air-conditioning. Never used either. I think what may have happened is this. We didn't use heat the first year we lived here, not sure why exactly - warm year? Beyond that, every time I thought about turning on the heat, I would consider the dust and god-knows-what-else accumulating in the vents and ducts. I would promptly put on a third sweater instead of reaching for the dial. The office has a fireplace, so I sit near that quite a bit. But the kitchen gets quite cold. So, when the weather cools off, I tend to bake. The oven keeps the kitchen cozy, and now and then I stand in front of it, crack the door, and let the hot air flow up under my sweater to warm me up. I baked this farro "risotto" last night instead of cooking it stove top, and it worked out nicely - lemon-kissed, bright tomato sauce, lots of Parmesan, and chopped fresh oregano. I use the term risotto loosely here :)
So, here's what you do. Start the grains on the stove top, add all the liquid at once, cover, and transfer to the oven for the better part of an hour. If you have a medium/large oven-proof casserole, like a Le Creuset, you can go start to finish in the same pot/casserole. Although, I can't remember if the knobs on the lids of Le Creuset can handle a 400F oven? It may be too hot - you may still need to use foil to cover the pot.
Calling this a risotto is a bit of a stretch, it's not particularly creamy or loose. It won't run across a plate. But when I make it on a stove top, I use a risotto technique, so that's sort of how I think of it. If you think you might like a more oozy, cheesy version, use small cubes of good mozzarella in place of the Parmesan in the recipe below, or experiment with a blend. I mean, it's cheese - you can make it as cheesy or un-cheesy as you like. I was after something with cheese, but not over-the-top decadent here.
Baked Farro Risotto Recipe You can bake this in an oven-proof casserole. As far as grains go, I used semi-pearled farro, but I can imagine making this with semi-pearled barley as well. Beyond that, arborio rice would be an logical and easy-to-find alternative. Different grains will likely affect the consistency of the risotto in the end, some might end up drier or more fluid, but you can adjust the baking time accordingly, and I don't think you'll be too far off using this amount of broth/water.
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for the baking pan & drizzling
zest of one lemon
1 medium onion
fine grain sea salt
1 1/2 cups / 10.5 oz / 300 g uncooked semi-pearled farro
1 cup / 8 oz / 225 g tomato sauce*
2 1/2 cups / 600 ml good-tasting vegetable broth or water
1 1/4 cups / 2 oz / 60g  freshly grated Parmesan
1 tablespoons fresh oregano, chopped
Preheat oven to 400F / 205C, with a rack in the top third.  Rub olive oil across an 8x8-inch baking dish, or equivalent, and sprinkle with lemon zest.
In a large saucepan over medium-high heat combine the olive oil, onion, and a couple pinches of salt. Cook until the onions soften up and begin to become translucent, a few minutes. Add the farro, stir until well-coated, and cook for another minute or two. Stir in the tomato sauce and the broth. Bring just to a simmer, remove from heat, and stir in about 3/4 of the cheese. Carefully taste a bit of the brothy liquid, and adjust the seasoning if needed. Transfer to the prepared baking dish, cover with foil, poke a few slits in the foil, and bake for about 45 minutes or until the grains are cooked through. You can uncover in the last few minutes to get a bit of color on the top of the farro. Alternatively, you can brown the top carefully under a broiler for a few minutes, which is what I did. Serve sprinkled with the remaining cheese, the fresh oregano, and a drizzle of good olive oil.
Serves 6.
*You can use your favorite tomato sauce here, but the following sauce is easy to make from scratch. It is bright and vibrant tasting - perfect to play off the grains. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. When hot, stir in a clove of garlic smashed into a paste with a couple pinches of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Cook just until the garlic starts to take on color, not more than 10-20 seconds, and stir in 1 cup / 8 oz / 225g of crushed tomatoes OR crushed fire-roasted tomatoes, from a can. Simmer for a few minutes more and remove from heat. Taste and add a bit more salt if needed.

Brown Butter Spice Cake
Oat Soda Bread Recipe January 11, 2011    |   191 Comments One of the things I love about the internet is the ping-pong culture of ideas. Here's an example. I love making soda bread. Homemade bread slathered with butter in less than an hour? Hard to beat. There are a million directions you can take soda breads, but the rye version I bake is a long-running favorite. I've never posted it here, but I include it in Super Natural Every Day . So, here's where things start to get interesting. Ten Speed sent out advance copies of the book to a number of food writers/editors a few weeks back. One of them was Jennifer Perillo. I follow Jennifer on Twitter . And last week she mentioned baking an oat soda bread based on the soda bread recipe in my book. Her bread looked beautiful. It's like I threw out a polka-dotted boomerang, and it came back to me plaid. So I decided to bake oat soda bread, based on Jennifer's version, adding a few twists of my own.
I'm not sure why I've never done an oat-centric soda bread, but the minute I saw Jennifer's it made perfect sense. The ingredient list is impossibly short: rolled oats, flour, buttermilk, baking soda, and salt - and some seeds if you like. I normally bake soda breads free-form, but I decided to try this one in a loaf pan. As I was making it, Wayne finished off a container of crackers, the only thing left was a couple of tablespoons of seeds, so I sprinkled those across the top of the bread, just before baking, to give it a crunchy crust.
The bread bakes up fragrant and a touch sweet from the oats. It is fantastic sliced and toasted along with a bowl of soup. Or slathered with jam and butter. Or with a creamy cheese and a sprinkling of herbs. I know I say it nearly every time I post a recipe like this, if you've never baked bread before, give it a go. Or if this doesn't look up your alley, you might find some ideas on Michael Ruhlman's blog right now. It's a great time of year for bread baking. Thanks again for the inspiration Jennifer :).
Oat Soda Bread Recipe I'm more likely to have rolled oats on hand than oat flour. So, like Jennifer, I instruct you to make your own oat flour below. But you can skip that step if you actually have oat flour in your pantry. As far as storage goes, loosely wrapped in parchment paper, this bread is great for a couple days.
butter, to grease pan
2 cups / 7 oz rolled oats
10 ounces / 285 g / ~2 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting and kneading
1 3/4 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/4 teaspoons fine-grain sea salt
1 3/4 cups / 415 ml buttermilk, plus more if needed, and 2T. for brushing
mixed seeds - sesame, caraway, poppy, etc.
Preheat the oven to 400°F / 205°C with a rack in the middle of the oven. Butter and line a 9x5x3 inch loaf pan (or one with ~8 cup capacity) with parchment paper and set aside. Alternately, you can bake this bread without a pan, shaped like this , on a lightly floured baking sheet.
To make the oat flour, use a food processor to pulse the rolled oats a few times. Then process into a fine powder - another minute or two. If you are buying oat flour, not making your own, measure out 7 oz / scant 2 cups.
Sift the flours, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the flour and pour in the buttermilk. Stir just until everything comes together into a dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured countertop and knead for 30 seconds or so, just long enough for the dough to come together into a cohesive, slightly flattened ball without many cracks or fissures. If your dough is on the dry side, add more buttermilk a small splash at a time. Now ease the dough evenly into the prepared baking pan - see photo if you need a bit of guidance.
Brush all over the top and sides with buttermilk and sprinkle generously with mixed seeds or flour, 2 tablespoons or so. Slice a few deep slashes across the top of the dough. Bake for about 30 minutes, then quickly (without letting all the hot air out of the oven), move the rack and the bread up a level, so the top of the bread gets nice and toasted. Bake for another 20 minutes, or until a hard crust forms and the bread is baked through. It will feel very solid and sound hollow when you knock on it. Carefully lift it out of the pan, in a timely fashion, and allow to cool on a wire rack. Enjoy with a good slathering of salted butter.
Makes one loaf.

Coconut Red Lentil Soup
Inspired by an Ayurvedic dal recipe in the Esalen Cookbook, this is a light-bodied, curry-spiced coconut broth thickened with cooked red lentils and structured with yellow split peas. The back notes of ginger, slivered green onions sauteed in butter, and curry-plumped raisins make this a new favorite of mine.

New Year Noodle Soup Recipe January  1, 2011    |   172 Comments I'm feeling the inclination to tip-toe into 2011. I'm concerned that if I step on one squeaky floorboard, all hell could break loose. For the most part 2010 was good to me, it was busy, interesting, unpredictable and fulfilling. I feel very, very fortunate. I consider every day I'm happy and healthy a gift. On the flip side, it was a difficult year for a number of people I know and care about, and to them, I hope 2011 shines better and brighter.
2010 was the year I finished this , spent three weeks here , and made many pots of soup along the way. I hung out at the cabin . And we camped , and camped some more . As far as 2011 is concerned, it looks like I'll be ushering in the new year with a nasty head cold and an awesome bowl of noodle soup. I can tell you with confidence, sparkling wine and throat lozenges are a terrible pairing.
That said, I'm looking forward to shaking this bug quickly to take a crack at making 2011 memorable and meaningful. I've been thinking about some of the things I'd like to focus on this year, and I've come up with a list of sorts...Here goes. I'd like to get out of San Francisco for trips near and far. Top of the list: London, Japan, the Pacific Northwest, and Kauai. I'm feeling the pull of a road trip, not sure of where yet though, Marfa? Across Canada? I've always wanted to drive to the tip of Baja, but I'm not sure that's the best idea right now. What else? I'd like to jog to the beach more often. And I'd like to take this big guy out more often. I want to commit to brewing beer once a month, and also stay current with the New Yorker. I want to cook from lots of books. Cook alongside lots of cooks. Get to know less familiar ingredients better. And revisit favorite recipes more often. I want to try keep things simple. I'm sure I'll think of others, but this is what is top of mind right now. What about you? I love hearing your new years thoughts and resolutions.
Today's recipe is exactly what I've been craving. I've cooked it twice now, and it's the perfect recipe to usher in the new year with, particularly if you have a cold. But let me back up a bit, and let you know how I came across it. One of my Aussie pals works in a bookshop in Melbourne that focuses on food and wine titles. She always has great insight into books and recipes, and she mentioned hosting Greg & Lucy Malouf in the shop one night. They made a trio of breads for the event from Saraban: A Chef's Journey Through Persia that sounded wonderful, and I had it in the back of my mind to flip through the book as soon as I could find it. I stumbled on the book at Omnivore Books , and bought it on the spot. The New Year Noodle Soup caught my attention, and I'm thrilled it did. At its core it is a bean and noodle soup featuring thin egg noodles swimming in a fragrant broth spiced with turmeric, cumin, chiles, and black pepper. You use a medley of lentils, chickpeas, and borlotti beans, making the soup hearty and filling without being heavy. You add spinach, dill, and cilantro. You add lime juice for a bit of sour at the end. And then you've got a number of toppings to add when you serve the soup - chopped walnuts, caramelized onions, and sour cream. It's a long ingredient list, but worth it. I think I'm going to double up on the next pot. It was delicious reheated for days, even with the noodles in there. The book itself is amazing, and I can't wait to explore it beyond this soup.
So here we go. 2011 it is. My hope is that each of you has a happy, healthy, and peaceful new year. I'd also like to add a heartfelt thank you for your ongoing insight and encouragement. Can you believe we're coming up on eight years together? It seems surreal to me. xo-h
New Year Noodle Soup If you don't have beans that have already been cooked you can use canned ones. Or you can soak the garbanzo & borlotti overnight, and add them after the broth comes to a boil. Cook for 15 minutes, then stir in the yellow split peas/lentils. This way the beans/lentils should be done cooking around the same time. The original recipe calls for fresh borlotti beans, which aren't in season. I used dried borlotti that I cooked a couple weeks back, then froze until now. And, on the noodle front, I couldn't help but add more than what the original recipe called for. You can actually use more/less noodles - even when it seemed like too much, they always manage to get slurped up in a soup like this.
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 long red chili OR green serrano, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
8 1/2 cups / 2 liters good-tasting vegetable stock/broth
100g / 3.5 oz yellow split peas or brown lentils
1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas, rinsed if using canned
2 cups / 350g cooked borlotti beans
fine grain sea salt
120 g thin egg noodles, fresh or dried
3 1/2 oz / 100g fresh spinach leaves, finely shredded
1/2 cup finely shredded cilantro leaves
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
juice of one lime
Toppings:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 large onion, thinly sliced
100 ml sour cream or creme fraiche
50g / scant 2 ounces of toasted, chopped walnuts
Heat the oil in a large, thick-bottomed soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and the chile and cook until they soften, a few minutes. Add the spices and cook for another thirty seconds, just long enough for them to toast a bit, then stir in the stock. Bring to a boil and add the split peas/lentils to the pot. Cook until they are just tender, about 25 minutes. Stir in the cooked chickpeas and borlotti beans. Once the beans have heated throughout, season with salt to taste.
In the meantime, you can prepare the toppings. Heat the olive oil and butter in a large frying pan over medium heat along with a couple big pinches of salt. Cook the onion, stirring occasionally, until golden and caramelized, 8 - 10+ minutes. Set aside.
Just before you're ready to eat, add the noodles to the simmering soup and cook until al dente. Stir in the spinach, and cilantro and dill. Add a big squeeze of lime to the pot or serve wedges along with each bowl of soup. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking.
Serve right away, each bowl topped with a big spoonful of caramelized onions, some creme fraiche, and a sprinkling of walnuts.
Serves about 4.

Healthy One Pan Recipes
My favorite healthy, one-pan recipes. The type of things that you can pull together any night of the week without too much fuss or fanfare. I love big-flavored, colorful stir-fries, and hearty chunky soups, so I included a lot of those types of recipes on the list.

Green Olive Gnocchi Recipe December  4, 2010    |   123 Comments Have any of you ever made a sauce from green olives? Me either. Until now. I found myself with a large container of pitted, herb-flecked green olives. And I mean a laaarge container. I don't know what I was thinking. I guess I bought them, intending to use them as part of a dinner spread for friends. Then promptly forgot they existed. I found them the following morning hiding behind a container of feta. And so, olive season on Pierce Street begins. You can imagine my excitement when, I came across a recipe I'd tagged many months ago in Maggie Beer's book, Maggie's Harvest . She makes green olive gnocchi, then tosses it in a quirky, off-beat lightly creamy green olive sauce. The perfect way to put a dent in my olive supply.
Before we start, let me warn you, this isn't a particularly attractive sauce. And, I'm being kind here. But the sauce is assertive and deliciously distinctive. Here's a case where finishing the gnocchi with a few flavorful garnishes like fried capers and chives made all the aesthetic difference in the world.
As far as the specifics go - it's worth noting, I did a quick version of Maggie's recipe, reflected in the recipe below. I used store-bought gnocchi, and pan-fried it until it was deeply golden and crusted, instead of making the gnocchi from scratch. You can dress the gnocchi lightly, or more heavily, based on your preference. The leftover green olive sauce kept nicely in the refrigerator for the better part of a week, and was delicious on pasta, over brown rice, and alongside a bit of crumbled goat cheese in an omelette.
I hope some of you give this a try. And now that I'm thinking about it, I think you could introduce some blanched broccoli if you like - a good way to get some green vegetables on the plate. Or even better, you might cut the florets extra small, and toss them in the pan with the gnocchi at the last minute to cook that way.
Green Olive Gnocchi Recipe You can see the olives I used in the photo up above. They were pitted and tossed with Herbes de Provence. I'm inclined to tell you to avoid canned olives here, seek out an olive bar if possible and go from there. Many Whole Foods Markets, Italian grocers, and natural food stores have olive bars, often near the cheese section.
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or clarified butter
scant 3/4 cup / 180 ml vegetable broth
1/3 cup / 80 ml heavy cream
1 2/3 cup / 200 g green olives, pitted and chopped
fresh lemon juice
1 pound store-bought gnocchi, either fresh or packaged
top with: fried capers, bread crumbs, toasted almonds, and/or chives
In a large skillet over medium high heat, saute the garlic and onion in the 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, until softened, a few minutes. Add the both and cream and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat, add the olives and let cool for a couple minutes. Transfer to a bowl and puree with a hand blender. Thin with a bit more warm cream or water if needed. Taste and add a bit of fresh lemon juice if you like. Set aside and keep warm.
Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil In a large skillet over medium high heat.  Pan-fry the gnocchi in a single layer until golden on both sides. Working in two batches if needed. A few of you have asked if you need to boil the gnocchi first, nope!
Toss the gnocchi with half of the sauce, taste, and add more sauce if you like. Salt and pepper to taste, then serve topped with fried capers, toasted bread crumbs, toasted almonds, and/or chives.
Any leftover sauce can be refrigerated for a few days.
Serves 4 - 6.

Evolving Tastes: Insalata Caprese

Friday, November 12, 2010 Insalata Caprese
Tomato, Mozzarella, and Basil salad
Several weeks ago, a young couple came over for dinner at short notice. They were in the area, and they are related to me, so neither of us felt the need for any formalities. We had afternoon tea and we chatted, and in parallel I did some cooking, asking them about their preferences as I went along. They wanted something simple and healthy. Based on what I had on hand, we decided on matki usal, brown rice, polis, and baby potatoes bhaji. I was going to make a cabbage koshimbir to go along with it. However, I had some gorgeous heirloom tomatoes in different colors, and also fresh mozzarella. They had never had a Caprese salad before, but seemed eager to try it out, so I made that. The classic Italian Insalata Caprese (salad in the style of Capri) fit just fine into the otherwise Maharashtrian slanted meal.
In fact, the guests watched me make it, and enjoyed it so much, that later they started making it at as well, and sent me an email to tell me about it. Sweet.
I have been making this salad for years, and it is a staple at almost every Italian restaurant. To me it is so basic that I would have never ever thought of putting it up on my blog. However, I found it gratifying to have taught my young relatives something they liked. So for people like them who are eager to try and enjoy new things, here is a recipe for a simple salad that depends on a few things of the highest quality. It needs excellent tomatoes and the best fresh mozzarella you can find. Both of these have to taste really good on their own for them to shine together.
Just because the classic combination is unbeatable, I rarely bother to make any variations it, but I do use the basic canvas to try out various salts or olive oils. A recent hit was using Himalayan pink salt. I don't know what it was about this tiny change, but it just turned out much better than usual, and so now I always use Himalayan pink salt in this salad. Italy meets India, as it does many times in my kitchen!
Insalata Caprese
Serves 2
Ingredients
8-10 oz (about 2-4, depending on size) ripe tomatoes
4 oz fresh mozzarella cheese (usually 1 medium ball)
10-15 basil leaves
big pinch of coarse salt
freshly ground pepper
about 1 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
Method
Slice the tomatoes into rounds. Drain the mozzarella cheese from its brine and slice it into rounds.
On a platter or tray, layer the slices of tomatoes, cheese, and basil leaves. You can also tear up the leaves and scatter them over the tomatoes and cheese. Season with salt, pepper, and gently drizzle olive oil to cover everything.
Note: Ignore those two olives in the picture. They were sitting in the fridge and had to be finished off.

About Food is certainly about eating and cooking, but it is also about the memories, the stories, the traditions, the discoveries, the rituals, the seasons, and everything else surrounding it. This blog hopes to capture that, and more.
Want else is Evolving? Even when there is time to cook, there isn't always time to photograph  it or write about it in great detail. So I have a parallel blog to capture unfinished posts, random thoughts, notes, and  sometimes badly taken pictures which weren't exactly meant to be  show-cased. There will be little to no proof-reading, and much less  stress.
If this main blog is the dining room, then think of the other one as the kitchen. It  is called Evolving Notes and is open by subscription, so if you would like to take a peek, send  me an email to evolvingtastes[at]gmail[dot]com, and I will add you to  the list.

Sweet and sour eggplants in creamy nut sauce
I said a big hurrah recently because it seems like 'baby eggplants' season has started now. Well, eggplant season in general, for which I have been waiting for several months. It has been a while since I bought much produce from a grocery store, so there are certain things that are just not in my purview if the farmers don't bring them in. Among the few things I miss are the eggplants. Fret no more, because hopefully they will go strong well into fall now. Which means there will be eggplants in the basket during each trip to the Farmers market, and it means that khatte meethe baingain will be devoured many times as well.
Ever since I found this recipe , via Culinary Annotations , it has been a complete keeper and has turned into one of the many recipes that I barely have to look up because I have made it so many times. Like several others in my rep, it never made it to the blog because I never had a good photo to accompany it. The reason for that should be obvious too - could never wait long enough to take a photo after it was cooked, and there were never any leftovers to photograph!
One of the interesting bits in the recipe is cooking the eggplant partially in a microwave. While I do not use the microwave for any real cooking, I thought I could give this a try, and I have to say that it was a good thing to listen to the chef! The eggplants get just a little tender in the microwave first, and then get charred and crisp just right on the stovetop.
The other thing I like about this recipe is that it is a lot less complicated than the traditional Maharashtrian stuffed eggplant (bharli vangi), so it can be made even on a busy weeknight.
Here is the paraphrased recipe with some tips, minor changes, and translations of ingredients to English.
Khatmitthe Baghari Baingan
Ingredients
Little baby eggplants 1/2 kg (about 12-15)
1-2 Tablespoons oil
1/4 cup peanuts
1 Tablespoon white poppy seeds (khus khus)
1 Tablespoon sesame seeds (beige)
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1 teaspoon red chili powder (cayenne)
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon sambhar powder
2 teaspoons tamarind (not concentrate)
1 Tablespoon jaggery
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoons fenugreek seeds (methi dana)
a few curry leaves
pinch of asafoetida
1-2 green chilies, slit lengthwise (optional)
Method
Dissolve the tamarind in 1/2 cup of hot water, and let is sit for 30 minutes or longer. Using a fork or your fingers, extract the pulp completely and strain it to  get tamarind juice.
Wash the eggplants and pat them dry. Make two cross slits on them without separating the slices. I remove the tops, and make the slits from there, but you can keep the top and make the slits from the opposite end. Rub them with a few drops of oil, and place on a microwave safe plate. Microwave for four to five minutes.
Grind the poppy seeds and sesame seeds to a fine powder. Add the peanuts towards the end and grind them as well.
Heat about 1 Tablespoon oil in a large wide pan, and add in the eggplants with a pinch of salt. Cook the eggplants for a few minutes, turning them a few times until they are golden brown on all sides.
Add the spices, and the nut and seed powder, and saute everything together for a minute. Add the tamarind juice, jaggery, salt to taste, and bring it to a gentle boil. Cook for 5-10 minutes, making sure the sauce starts to seep into the eggplants. Add a little water if needed, by the tablespoon, if the sauce starts to thicken up.
In a separate tadka pan (or butter warmer, or small saucepan), heat about a teaspoon of oil, and add the asafoetida, fenugreek seeds, curry leaves, and green chilies. When they start to crackle, pour everything over the eggplants.

Evolving Tastes: Very Simple Spinach and Potato bhaaji
skip to main | skip to sidebar
Sunday, February 21, 2010 Very Simple Spinach and Potato bhaaji
pAlak BaTATA BhAjI
In Maharashtrian cooking, there is a not so uncommon practice of adding potatoes to anything, that sometimes drives me nuts. Flower-batata, bhendi-batata, farasbee-batata, pretty much any vegetable you can think of gets paired with potatoes. While I like each vegetable on its own, and I can have potato on its own, the fascination of these pairings escapes me. It is purely a personal preference, because they are quite popular, and I know so many people who really prefer the two together, even within my own family.
As always, there are exceptions, and one of them is this rather homey palak batata, which is how my mother makes it. I happened to learn it from her a few years ago during a trip back to India. It is just one example of the kind of food I am likely to cook on weekdays, even when I don't have any time at all. It doesn't need much measurement and precision, and has a low effort-to-nutrition ratio. I have tried some simple variations to this bhaaji like adding garlic or onion, but I much rather like this original version. A few warm chapatis or rice and plain dal are the perfect accompaniment for a delicious and comforting meal.
Spinach and Potato Bhaji
Ingredients
1 bunch of spinach (about 3-4 cups when chopped)
2-3 medium sized thin skinned potatoes
1-2 Tablespoons oil
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds
a pinch of asafoetida
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
3/4-1 teaspoon red chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
10-12 (or more) sprigs of cilantro
Pluck the spinach leaves, discarding tough stems. Rinse the spinach leaves and leave them to drain in a colander or sieve or something like a salad spinner basket.
Wash the potatoes. Slice it along the length, and then slice each half along the length again. Slice each resulting quarter thinly along the width. If there is too much starch I rinse them off quickly and drain.
In a wide pan or wok, heat the oil, and add the mustard seeds. As they start to pop, add the asafoetida and turmeric, followed by the potato. Saute the potatoes until all the slices are coated with oil, then lower the heat to medium high and cook for a few minutes. Stir them around once more, turn the heat down a little more, place a lid on the pan, and let them cook until tender. You can use a fork to check.
While the potatoes cook, finely chop the spinach. Or give it a few quick pulses in the food processor. Finely chop the cilantro.
Add the spinach to the potatoes, the red chili powder, and salt. Toss everything together, add the cilantro, and place the lid back on to let everything cook for just a few minutes.

Evolving Tastes: Apple Apricot and Fig Chutney
skip to main | skip to sidebar
Sunday, December 16, 2007 Apple Apricot and Fig Chutney
One good substitution deserves another
Food bloggers can be admirably observant at times. For instance, consider the picture of a plateful of food , with poori and bhaji as stars of the post , and yet, what two of my favorite bloggers, Richa and Bee asked me was about the tiny speck of Apple Chutney, which was nearly hidden under a papad! Giving them the recipe was the easy part, but if I had to post it, then an unwritten requirement was to take a halfway decent photo of it, and that meant I needed a fresh batch of it, since I was already out of it.
The original recipe is from Madhur Jaffrey's Indian Cooking, and called 'Apple, Peach and Apricot Chutney' translated into Hindi as 'sev, aroo, aur kubani ki chutney'. Even though one should not judge food by looks alone, it was the orange hued picture of the chutney in a silver bowl that first caught my attention and made me want to try it out. I checked how many apples it called for, and set two aside to make a half batch of it. It was when I was ready to start cooking that I realized that I did not have any dried peaches. Dried apricots are usually in the pantry, but dried peaches, never. Ever so resourceful, I used dried papaya instead and proceeded, and it was a hit. It was absolutely easy to make, and it was evident that the quantities of the seasonings could be easily adjusted according to taste.
The next time, I didn't have any dried papaya, so I used dried figs from India, you know, those types that come in the form of discs on some sort of a string, most often seen in the Diwali dry fruit boxes wrapped with yellow cellophane? I don't particularly like those, and don't remember how they landed home, but they were sitting for a long time, so they were put to good use in the chutney in place of the dried papaya, I mean, peaches. So that's the story of the chutney that the ladies spotted in the picture.
Now with the bounty of delicious local fall and winter apples here, that is what I decided to make, but this time, I didn't have any dried figs on hand either! So I went to buy some and was staring at the Black Mission and Calimyrna, thinking what a difficult choice this was, did a eena-meena-mina-mo on them, and went for the Calimyrnas. The apples I used were Jonagolds, but nearly any type of apple works here just fine.
Apple Apricot and Fig (or Peach or Papaya) Chutney
Yields
About 4 cups chutney
Ingredients
1/2 kg apples (4-5 medium sized apples)
3/4 cup dried apricots
3/4 cup dried figs
1/2 cup golden raisins
4 cloves garlic
2 X 1 inch cube ginger
1-1/2 cups white vinegar
1-1/2 cups granulated sugar
2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Method
Core, peel, and chop the apples. Chop the dried figs and apricots into pieces as large or small as you like. Mince the garlic, and grate the ginger.
Combine all the ingredients in a medium sized stainless steel pan, and bring to a boil. Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for about 30-40 minutes until it reaches a thick consistency similar to jam. Stir occasionally if required to prevent sticking.
Let it cool in the pan for some time. It will thicken slightly more as it cools. Let cool completely before filling into a jar.
Notes, Substitutions
The above recipe is what I have made, with changes to the original . I have reduced the amount of garlic a little, and increased the amount of cayenne pepper.
The original recipe uses white wine vinegar, but I use white distilled vinegar or apple cider vinegar. The vinegar could fume during cooking, so make sure to turn on the exhaust or keep a window open.
I have reduced the amount of sugar significantly from the original, and yet it is somewhat sweet in taste, but the sugar is required for preserving the chutney for a longer period. I have been able to keep the chutney in good condition for a few months without having to refrigerate it.
Taking a cue from a certain new cookbook title, this chutney is tangy, tart, hot and sweet! It should also come with a warning that there is a danger that this chutney might be consumed in side dish quantities rather than as a condiment, but that should be alright, considering that it contains things that are mostly good for you.

Reviews for Almond-Scented White Cake
4.8 out of 5
14 total review(s)
Ingredients: 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 Tbs. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
12 Tbs. (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 tsp. vanilla extract
1 tsp. almond extract
1 cup milk
5 egg whites, at room temperature
3/4 cup raspberry preserves, melted
Raspberries (optional)
1 1/4 cups sliced almonds, lightly toasted and cooled
For the cream cheese frosting: 1 lb. cream cheese, at room temperature
6 Tbs. (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 1/4 cups confectioners’ sugar
1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
1 1/2 tsp. almond extract
Directions: Position a rack in the middle of an oven and preheat to 350ºF. Butter and flour 2 round cake pans each 9 inches in diameter and 1 1/2 inches deep.
In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer set on medium-high speed, beat the butter until light. Gradually add the sugar, beating until well blended. Beat in the vanilla and almond extracts. Reduce the speed to low and, dividing the flour mixture into 3 batches, beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture alternately with the milk just until combined.
In a large bowl, using an electric mixer fitted with clean, dry beaters and set on high speed, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the beaten whites into the batter just until incorporated. Divide the batter between the prepared pans; smooth with the spatula.
Bake until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Run a sharp knife around the pan sides to loosen the cakes. Invert onto racks and let cool completely.
Meanwhile, make the cream cheese frosting: In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese and butter. Using an electric mixer set on medium-high speed, beat until smooth. Reduce the speed to low, add the confectioners' sugar and again beat until smooth. Beat in the vanilla and almond extracts until well blended.
Using a long serrated knife, cut each cake in half horizontally. Place 1 layer on a plate. Spread 1/2 cup of the frosting over the top, then drizzle on 1/4 cup of the melted preserves. Top with another cake layer and repeat with the same amounts of frosting and preserves. Top with a third cake layer and again repeat with the same amounts of frosting and preserves. Top with the fourth cake layer, cut side down.
Spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides. Ring the top with raspberries, if using, and press the toasted almonds onto the sides.
Serve immediately, or cover with a cake dome and refrigerate for up to 1 day. Bring to room temperature before serving.
Makes one 9-inch cake; serves 10 to 12.

Evolving Tastes: Carrot, Beet, and Jicama koshimbir
skip to main | skip to sidebar
Wednesday, December 31, 2008 Carrot, Beet, and Jicama koshimbir
If I said that I have been busy for the last few months, that would be quite an understatement. The blog was started and nurtured in calmer times, but as other things took over, it fell aside. I did have things to write about at the back of my mind, but time wasn't in my favor.
A well-intentioned post for a friend's JFI event got delayed, and even my own 2nd blogiversary post couldn't be completed in time. Finally, I couldn't let the year end without one last post.
I have mentioned before that koshimbirs are a favorite of mine. These are usually dismissed as simple seasonal salads, but fortified with peanuts, and amped with seasonings, they are bright with flavor and texture.
This combination came together one evening inspired by what was bought at the farmers' market, and based on my usual recipe for carrot koshimbir. The jicama added a crisp sweetness, and the beets added color and earthiness to create a completely new favorite which was deliciously addictive, and healthy to boot. I practically finished the entire bowlful.
This can be made with only carrots and will be called gajarachi koshimbir, the Maharashtrian carrot salad. As always, all seasonings can be adjusted to taste, but my preference is to have a good balance of heat, tang, and sweetness.
Carrot, Beet, and Jicama koshimbir
Ingredients
1 medium carrot
1 small beetroot (raw is fine)
1 small jicama
1/4 cup crushed peanuts
3/4 teaspoon red chili powder
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
For phodni (tempering):
1 teaspoon oil
pinch of mustard seeds
pinch of asafoetida (hing)
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1 green chili, slit lengthwise into 2
1 Tablespoon lemon juice
1 Tablespoon chopped cilantro
Method
Grate the carrot, beet, and jicama in a medium sized bowl. Add the peanuts, chili powder, salt, and sugar.
Heat the oil in a small pan. Add the mustard seeds, and when they start to pop, add the asafoetida, turmeric, and chili. When the chili starts to change color, pour the oil over the rest of the ingredients.
Add the lemon juice and cilantro, and stir everything together to mix.
Have a healthy and happy new year!

About Food is certainly about eating and cooking, but it is also about the memories, the stories, the traditions, the discoveries, the rituals, the seasons, and everything else surrounding it. This blog hopes to capture that, and more.
Want else is Evolving? Even when there is time to cook, there isn't always time to photograph  it or write about it in great detail. So I have a parallel blog to capture unfinished posts, random thoughts, notes, and  sometimes badly taken pictures which weren't exactly meant to be  show-cased. There will be little to no proof-reading, and much less  stress.
If this main blog is the dining room, then think of the other one as the kitchen. It  is called Evolving Notes and is open by subscription, so if you would like to take a peek, send  me an email to evolvingtastes[at]gmail[dot]com, and I will add you to  the list.

Stunning Sour Cream & Rhubarb Cake Cakes & Brownies | Fruit Flavour
Don’t you hate it when you underestimate how much cake batter you will have with a mixture and end up using a mixing bowl which is far, far too small for it. And then you end up battling waves of cake batter with your hands and a spatula, while simultaneously trying to hold the bowl still and getting batter all over your arms. AND THEN, a single strand of hair decides to start poking you in the eyeball and you’d attempt to blow it off your face and you think that it’d be so much easier if you could just brush it off using a hand but then that would mean that you end up with cake batter on your face and in your hair. And during all this, you’re berating yourself for not using a bigger mixing bowl but if you pull one out now then that will mean you have yet another dish to wash AS WELL AS ADMITTING DEFEAT TO THE CAKE.
*takes a deep breath*
Sure, the above may not have happened to you (probably because you, my darling readers, are not quite as abysmally stubborn or insane as I am), but you can put yourself in my shoes and be aware of the mindset that I was in when my sister, at that VERY moment when my baking world was drowing in sticky brown sugar cake batter, decided to waltz up to me and ask what I was making.
“Sour cream & rhubarb cake” was my grumbled response.
“Ewwww”, she replied. “I hate rhubarb”
SRFGOHN:RGJK:RH?IOJK!)*&RT)({&$(!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN, YOU HATE RHUBARB?!”
Okay, so I didn’t mean to holler that bit, and felt a bit bad when she cowered slightly from the manic tone in my voice, but still – come on! Who hates rhubarb? How can you hate rhubarb?
Well, I might understand a dislike of rhubarb if someone at some stage convinced you to gnaw on a raw stalk, but when properly cooked, it’s one of those divine foodstuffs which can help create a wonderful sour balance to sweetness, akin the the powers of the almighty lemon.
*takes a moment to bow to the lemon gods*
After some Kitchen Wench-style interrogation , I discovered that my sister didn’t actually hate rhubarb, but that she had never actually eaten it before. Which actually brings me to a pet peeve of mine – saying you hate a food because you’ve never had it before. When it comes to something such as crumbed and deep fried sheeps brains , I can understand being a little hesitant, but rhubarb is a classic dessert foodstuff which can be so incredibly tasty when treated with the respect that it deserves!
As this was the case, I coerced my sister into enjoying a slice of the cake once it was out of the oven, with a big decadent dollop of double cream and this was enough to change her tune from “I hate rhubarb” to “Oh-my-god-this-rhubarb-cake-is-freakin-DELICIOUS!”
I can’t take any credit for the cake itself since the recipe comes from Australia’s own baking goddess, Belinda Jeffery, but what I can do is vouch for it’s fabulousness. The cake can be served almost like a pudding when taken straight out of the oven, or you can let it cool and firm up a bit, at which point it becomes this unctuous, incredibly moist and tender structure, with delightful chunks of rhubarb to balance the richness and sweetness of the cake itself.
It’s rather homely in appearance, but while I wouldn’t use this for a wedding cake, it’s the perfect sort of morsel that you’d enjoy around the kitchen table with a cup of tea, a little dollop of cream on the side and while enjoying a quiet, peaceful afternoon
Sour Cream & Rhubarb Cake
(recipe from “The Country Cookbook” by Belinda Jeffery)
Ingredients
350g (2 & 1/3 cups) Self-Raising Flour
1/2 tsp salt
2 tsp cinnamon
60g unsalted butter, at room temperature
330g (1 & 1/2 cups) firmly packed brown sugar
1 large egg
3 tsp pure vanilla extract
240g (1 cup) sour cream
440g (4 cups) rhubarb, cut into 1cm chunks
1/4 tsp grated nutmeg
110g (1/2 cup) caster sugar
25g (1/3 cup) flaked almonds (not necessary, but it adds a nice aesthetic to the cake)
Pure cream or vanilla ice cream, to serve
1. Preheat your oven to 180 degrees C and grease a 26cm round cake tin (I just used non-stick baking paper as this ensures easy clean up). Then mix together the flour, salt and 1 and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon in a bowl with a whisk and set aside. Put the butter and brown sugar into a separate bowl and beat till the mixture resembles (and feels like) wet sand.
3. Once the butter is fully incorporated, add the egg and beat will till the mixture is fluffy and creamy and there are no more lumps of sugar.
4. Add the sour cream and vanilla and beat in till well combined.
5. Mix in the flour on low speed till combined, then add your rhubarb chunks and stir briskly to make sure that the rhubarb is completely coated in batter. PLEASE use a large bowl like I did in the pictures, as if you don’t (like my first attempt at this cake), you will end up with a overflowing bowl of messy deliciousness that will go EVERYWHERE!!)
6. Once the mixture is combined, scrape it into your prepared cake tin and sprinkle the top liberally with flaked almonds and caster sugar. I didn’t have any almonds the second time I made this (as you can see in the picture), but I actually found that the top stayed nice and crunchy even longer without the almonds. Go figure!
7. Bake the cake for 1 hour and 10 minutes, or till a wooden skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. Now at this stage you can serve it as a pudding by scooping it out of the container with a large spoon and serving with a dollop of vanilla bean ice cream…but if you wait till it cools down, it tastes even better as a luscious, tender cake with lashings of pure cream.
NOW! I’ve actually got a bit of rather exciting news for you, my darling readers! I’ve actually been asked to be a columnist for a new food magazine that is starting up this year, called The Gourmet Kitchen! As far as I’m aware, it will be published quarterly here in Australia, but the first edition is coming out in June and I hope that you’ll follow my adventures in print as well as here! And don’t worry, I’ll still be running this blog…it just means that you can find my inane ramblings elsewhere as well
To anyone who is interested in reading the print articles when they come out, I’ll keep you posted closer to the actual publishing date, but I was so excited that I wanted to share the good news! And I also wanted to thank all my readers – for following my nonsensical utterings and stream-of-consciousness rants for what is now almost 5 years ! Your comments and emails are what help keep this blog going, and it’s been a blast I can’t wait to see what else the future has to bring for us together!

Tasty Tempura Seafood | Vegetables & Vegetarian
What is it about frying food that makes it so delicious? I mean, I have to honestly say that I question creations such as fried cookie dough (come on guys, are you serious??) and deep fried butter (I genuinely thought that my brother was KIDDING when he told me about this. And then I googled it and barfed), but things such as a freshly deep-fried churros served with a dark chocolate dipping sauce are, quite simply put, glorious.
And then, my darling ones, we have tempura .
Deep frying foodstuffs can definitely be a bit of a intimidating task. Besides the fact that you have a boiling, spitting pot of liquid DEATH to navigate, there’s also the question of cooking temperatures and patience. If the oil isn’t hot enough then the food will just marinate in oil and emerge a soggy, revolting mound of mush. If the oil is too hot, then everything will look cooked on the outside…till you bite into the food and discover that it’s near to raw.
At which point, your tastebuds will go “ AWW. BIGSADFACE ”
Even if you’re using a candy thermometer to gauge the oil temperature, then you have to still monitor the temperature continuously as everything cooks.
Take it from me, folks. Deep frying food is not for the faint-hearted. No, really. If you have a heart condition relating to clogged arteries, it’s probably best that you don’t go down this road.
*listens to the sound of crickets chirping in the distance*
Yeah, I know. Pretty tasteless joke. But hey, it’s been awhile since I’ve put up a decent post! I’ve gotta work through the writer’s block and just get the crap out of my system!
Anyway, back to the tempura.
As far as I’m concerned, tempura is the ultimate when it comes to fried savoury goodness. The KISS rule definitely applies here – Keep It Simple, Stupid ! Working with fresh, raw ingredients, you coat them in an incredibly light batter and fry them till just cooked. While some people use beer to lighten their batter, using a combination of plain flour and corn starch will work fine so long as the batter is kept close to ice cold.
Unfortunately, I can’t help you with your deep frying skills, but tempura is a wonderful cooking method to master, so here are some straightforward tips that I can offer in the hopes that I’ll tempt you to give it a go
Keeping the batter ice-cold is a must. This means ICE – and lots of it!
Use fresh ingredients and make sure everything is cut into small/thin and uniform pieces. This means a quicker and more even cooking time – the longer the item is sitting in the oil, the worse off you are. In terms of your fresh vegetables such as green beans and capsicums/bell peppers, you don’t want them completely cooked through, but to retain some texture and crunch – just not be completely raw!
While tempura can be enjoyed on it’s own or with rice, it’s seriously awesome served with udon noodles and a dipping sauce of soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and a little wasabi. The dipping sauce in particular can help cut through the heaviness and oiliness of the tempura itself (though if cooked properly and served while hot, the oiliness shouldn’t be too big an issue). Also, tempura prawns are great in sushi hand rolls!
Serve your tempura as soon after cooking as possible, ensuring that there is good drainage for the excess oil to drip away onto. This isn’t a dish that you can cook beforehand and serve up an hour later at the dinner table. This usually means that the cook is the last person to enjoy it, but I’m sure that after going to this much effort, you won’t be expected to clean the dishes
When deep frying any food, make sure to use an oil with a high smoke point. This, unfortunately, completely rules out olive oil (there’s apparently a few other reasons why olive oil should never be used for deep frying). I tend to like using sunflower oil – I trust it more than plain vegetable oil, it’s cheap, has a neutral flavour and is perfectly fine for this sort of cooking.
Don’t rush it! If you’re inexperienced when it comes to deep-frying, then take it slow and don’t rush yourself. Also, it’s probably not a bad idea to keep a fire blanket close at hand (water on an oil fire is a huuuuuuuuge no-no!)
Tempura
Sauce ingredients
1 cup tempura flour **
1 1/4 cup ice-cold water
1 large egg
A pinch of salt and pepper
500mL – 1L neutral flavoured oil, such as sunflower oil (depending on the size of the pot you’re using for the frying)
Vegetables and seafood for frying
** If you don’t have access to tempura flour, you can make your own by sifting together 3/4 cup plain or all-purpose flour with 1/4 cup corn starch
1. Prepare your ingredients – they should be as fresh as possible! Some of my favourites are prawns, sweet potato, potato, Korean perilla leaves (also known as shiso, it is different in taste and appearance to Japanese shiso), green beans and capsicum (aka bell peppers).
2. Stir together the flour, egg, water and salt and pepperin light, quick motions till most of the lumps are gone (it doesn’t need to be completely smooth). What you need to do now is to sit the bowl in an ice bath (a larger bowl which has ice cubes and a little water. This is what will keep your batter nice and light – if the temperature of the batter comes up, it will get thicker and stickier and the end result will be thicker and not as desired.
3. Heat the oil to about 170-180 degrees C, then working with quick hands you need to batter some veggies and put them in the oil to cook. Remember not to crowd the pot – this will drop the temperature of the oil too rapidly and will mean that the batter won’t retain any crispness and become heavy and soggy.
The best way to test when the oil is ready is to drop a little batter into it – when the oil is yet to reach the right temperature, the drop of batter will sink to the bottom then slowly rise back up. You can tell when the oil has reached the right temperature when a drop of batter begins to bubble furiously the moment it hits the oil and stays on the surface rather than displaying any sinking action!
Once your tempura ingredients are cooked (different vegetables require different cooking times), lay them on some trays lined with paper towel in a single layer to ensure adequate drainage. Once drained, plate up as you like and serve with some dipping sauce

Pining for the sun with Pineapple Jelly Cheese & Dairy | Desserts | Fruit Flavour
Dear Spring,
I get it.
You have a sense of humour.
You’re part of Mother Nature’s gang of bullies, and we mere mortals have no say in how you behave.
The least you could do is not piss yourself laughing when I  drag my sorry corpse  into the car at 6:45am in the morning, wrapped in a  blanket and  shivering while I curse your name and the fact that warmth  appears to  have forsaken those of us here in Melbourne.
I’m sorry for complaining at you…
Now, could you please stop stuffing us about and bring out the sun?
xoxo,
Ellie
As most of you darling readers are based in the Northern Hemisphere, I’m guessing that you’re not too familiar with the fabulous little corner of my world that is Melbourne, Australia. It’s a fantastic city to live in with lots of great cafes / bars / restaurants / pubs, a thriving live music scene and a wonderfully eclectic mix of people residing here.
HOWEVER, this city of mine does have one downfall.
The “FABULOUS” WEATHER.
The joke across the country is that Melbourne’s weather cannot be predicted, and that our the weather forecasters do their jobs by either throwing dice or asking a magic 8 ball. Tthanks to this fact, Melbournians have perfected the art of dressing in layers and hiding their umbrellas in the most incredible and unexpected places on their person.
No, not there . Tsk tsk, I’ll thank you to pull your mind out of the gutter!
As the state has been experiencing drought conditions for quite a few years, there were many loud cheers when the heavens broke and started drenching us with rain over the winter months.
And when they did it again in the beginning of spring, we still cheered.
And in the second month of spring, when we were still being kept rather soggy by the skies, the cheers weren’t quite so enthusiastic…but they were still there.
We’re now at the arse-end of November and we’ve had only ONE day that’s topped 30 degrees C (that’s 86 degrees F to you Northerners), the rest of the time the temperature has wavered around the 20 degree C (68 degree F) mark. And since I need to wake up at 4:30am in the morning to get ready and commute to work, this means that only 3 weeks from the beginning of summer, I am STILL defrosting my windshield in the morning and cursing the skies.
So how am I coping with this unseasonal weather?
Well, I don’t know how my fellow Melbournians feel about it all, but personally I’m over the soups and stews that sustained me over the colder months, and I’m aching for the fruits that only grace us at this time of the year so that I can enjoy their bounty many times over before they disappear again.
As I had some pineapple left over after making the dried pineapple baskets (thanks again to the King of Fruit growers for sending me a box of these much loved fruits!), I decided that I’d make a nice soft jelly as dessert for a dinner party that the olds were holding. Perfect, since there are quite a few crowns and dentures holding them together – I figured that a soft, barely sweet dessert made with the acidity of pineapple would hit the spot.
However – before we venture any further – did you know that you can’t actually make a gelatin-based jelly using fresh pineapple?
You see, pineapple contains an enzyme called bromelain which actually breaks down protein. While this makes fresh pineapple juice fabulous for being used in a meat marinade as it will tenderize the protein…when used with gelatin, it will break it down so you’re left with nothing but pineapple soup!
The trick here is that the pineapple needs to be diced quite small and then simmered until it is completely soft. This cooking process will actually denature the enzyme responsible for potential mischief, leaving you to complete your journey to jiggly joy unhindered.
Well, relatively so. Even with the cooking process, this dish is best created and served within 24-48 hours as after that point, the little bit of enzyme left in the pineapple will begin to reverse the process of liquid to solid and leave you with mushy despair.
If you have access to fresh, ripe pineapple and you’re looking for a dessert which is light on the palate, then I would like to humbly suggest that you give this a try. The pineapple does retain some of its texture and fresh flavour despite the cooking, and it’s mild acidity is a lovely counterbalance to the creaminess of the panna cotta – so that the two sit harmoniously side by side!
That, and it’s a little way to bring some sunshine inside when you’re feeling despondent about the never-ending rain
Pineapple Jelly w/ Vanilla Panna Cotta
Pineapple jelly ingredients:
1 large pineapple, peeled and diced into 1cm pieces
125ml fresh lemon juice
125ml water
80g caster sugar
3-4 cups pineapple juice (any leftover liquid can be set as plain pineapple jelly)
2 tbsp powdered gelatin
Vanilla panna cotta ingredients:
1 1/2 cups milk
1/2 cup double cream
2 1/2 tsp powdered gelatin
1 tsp vanilla extract (or 1 vanilla pod, split in half with seeds scraped into the milk)
1. Mix the vanilla into the milk, then sprinkle the gelatin over the top and leave for 10-15 minutes to ‘bloom’. Then, add to a small pot along with the cream and stir over a low flame till the gelatin has completely dissolved. Simmer for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and set aside.
2. Prepare 6 smallish wine glasses or tumblers (making sure that they are spotlessly clean inside), then share half the panna cotta mixture between them and place in the fridge for approx 1 1/2 – 2 hours or till relatively set (the panna cotta shouldn’t be liquid when you tip the glass sideways, though some bulging is OK).
3. While the panna cotta is setting, sprinkle the gelatin for the jelly over the lemon juice and leave to bloom for another 10-15 minutes. Setting the lemon juice and gelatin aside, pour the remaining ingredients into a pot and boil for 30 minutes, or till the pineapple can be poked through with a skewer with little to no resistance.
4. Once the pineapple is cooked, bring the heat down so that it is just at a simmer then stir in the lemon juice and gelatin and stir till completely dissolved. Then divide the pineapple mixture between the 6 glasses by spooning in the pieces first and then spooning over the liquid till the pineapple chunks are just covered.
5. Allow the pineapple an hour or two to set, then divide the remaining panna cotta between the glasses (gently reheat over a low flame if it has begin to solidify while the pineapple is setting), set in the fridge and leave till they’re ready to be served!
Though there’s enough cream in this dish as it is, I found that some very lightly whipped vanilla cream (just cream whipped with vanilla bean) and a sprinkling of toasted coconut flakes made a tasty (though unecessary) addition to the dish. If you’re wanting to improve the aesthetics of the dish, then it can’t hurt to add a slice of dried pineapple either

Beef & mushroom ragu pasta bake Beef | Rice, Noodles, Pasta & Grains
It looks quite a treat, doesn’t it?
A rich, unctuous pasta bake plated next to a side of blanched & seasoned spinach.
However, if there’s one rule in life which is generally a good one to bear in mind, it’s that looks can be very, very deceiving.
There is nothing extravagant or unique about this dish. It’s not going to win any competitions for looks or flavours, but it is a simple, homely comforting food that is perfect for our current Melbourne winters.
This is the kind of dinner that you make to feed a family of 4 when the budget is stretched a little thin, the weather is cold outside and you want something hearty and filling that will satisfy both the tastebuds as well as the wallet.
Beef & Mushroom Ragu Pasta Bake
Ingredients
1/2 onion
2 sticks celery
2-3 cloves garlic, finely sliced
250g mushrooms
500g beef mince
2 tbsp reduced salt tomato paste
1 x 400g tin crushed tomatoes
250mL red wine (can be replaced with beef stock)
1 tsp dried oregano
Salt & pepper, to taste
2 cups barely cooked pasta (go with a penne or fusilli to catch the sauce) – you want it al dente or a little less cooked than that!
1/2 cup freshly grated mozarella
1/4 cup pine nuts
1. Dice your onion and celery into uniform pieces and also clean and dice the mushroom into larger pieces (as mushroom shrinks as it cooks). Heat up a little olive oil in a deep frying pan and saute the celery, onion and garlic till the onion is softened and translucent. Preheat your oven to 180 degrees C.
2. Add the mince and cook together, breaking up any clumps that form. Once the beef mince is cooked through, add the mushroom and stir through till the mushroom has cooked.
3. Add the tomato paste and stir it through, then add the crushed tomatoes and wine or stock and bring it to a slow simmer for about 20-30 minutes, or till the liquid is reduced and thickened. Make sure to give the mixture a stir every now and then so nothing catches and burns on the bottom.
4. Pour half the sauce into a large 20cm x 30cm baking tray (or roughly equivalent size, it doesn’t make a great deal of difference), then layer the pasta in the middle.
6. Add the remaining pasta sauce on top then gently mix it all together.
5. Add your grated mozarella over the top, then scatter over the pine nuts. Place into the oven and bake for 30 minutes, then serve immediately with a side of bitter greens.
Unfortunately this is not one of those dishes that freezes well, but I have found that it will generously serve a family of 4 with one or two serves left over (depending on how voracious your diners are). And those leftover serves tend to disappear pretty quickly, so the lack of freezing shouldn’t deter you from trying this out for your family!
Unfortunately all I had on me the day I made this was lots of spinach, but lightly sauteed in some garlic-infused olive oil, it was a lovely green and homely side dish to this rather lovely pasta bake.

Reply New @Ellie - @Ada - LOL! They have the same mushroom problem as my kid sister then :)

@Asianmommy - I can't understand the lack of mushroom love! But thankfully, if you slice anything small enough then it can be hidden in a dish like this :)

@Jane - Please let me know if you do :)

@Wizzythestick - It's very much a midweek budget meal to please the masses :)

@Betty @ The Hungry Girl - Thanks for the lovely comment hon :)

@my little expat kitchen - This whole opposite ends of the globe thing is a bit frustrating! Myself, I can't wait till we get blueberries back in season again!

@justcooknyc - Thanks for the lovely comment, and I can certainly understand not wanting to turn on the oven in the middle of summer ;-)

Marvellous Minestrone Legumes & Pulses | Pork | Rice, Noodles, Pasta & Grains | Stews, Soups & Salads
Hi!
Remember me?
That’s right, it’s your friendly (virtual) neighborhood Kitchen Wench, finally burrowing out of the ether to confirm that yes, I am in fact still alive.
I honestly can’t believe that I haven’t posted since the beginning of August – almost as much as I can’t believe that we’re nearing the end of October, and that I am very quickly bearing down on the 27th anniversary of the day that I was pushed out into the world, kicking and wailing to within an inch of my life (well, that’s what mother tells me, anyway).
So, what have I been up to all this time?
Well, one of the better things would be that I managed to take my mother away on a well-deserved holiday to a lovely place in Queensland called Brampton Island , where I successfully managed to p*ss off more than one wild kangaroo (and I would like to ask WHY nobody ever told me that kangaroos are scary as all hell?!), swam with fishes in crystal clear ocean waters , harassed more than my fair share of hermit crabs , witnessed some absolutely stunning sunsets and shared the most memorable time with my darling mother…
I tell you, when you see your mother bouncing excitedly up and down in a little boat because she thinks she’s caught a fish, then watch her reel up a rather small piece of coral, it takes almost all your self-control not to wet your pants laughing. Personally, I was laughing so hysterically that I almost fell overboard…though I did feel a little bad when I saw her disappointment. Thankfully that only lasted a moment as the next minute we saw a mother humpback whale teaching her calf to breach only a few hundred metres from where we were.
As for the rest of my absence? What can I say except that life needed my full attention. But I’m back, hopefully with a post that will entertain, amuse and tantalize…though that’s really for you to determine
One of the reasons for my absence has been freebies .
Wait, what?
Yeah, you read right.
Free bloody food.
(Though not literally bloody. Don’t forget that I’m Aussie-bred!)
You see, being a food blogger means occasionally being sent food samples to try and review. I will often think about an offer for a few days to a week before I reply, and will only accept if I think that it’s a worthwhile product that I may have genuine future interest in. Even then, after I accept the offer, I will often deliberate for weeks on what I think is the best way to test and also to showcase the product that I have been offered.
Which brings me to the case of the tinned tomatoes.
Tinned tomatoes – it’s one of those staples that you can keep in the pantry for aeons, and can use in a myriad of different dishes. I tend to keep a few tins of unflavored diced Italian (Roma) tomatoes in the pantry for this very reason, and have found that this has served me quite well – especially when I’ve needed to whip something up in a hurry.
My penchant for creating flavours of my own to suit my own tastebuds means that as a general rule, I tend to avoid any food which has been pre-flavoured – pasta sauces, ANY sort of frozen meal, jars of marinade…you get the drift. Therefore when I received an email asking me if I would like to try a few jars of Ardmona’s new range of flavoured tinned tomatoes , I deliberated a bit before deciding not to take up the offer.
So you can imagine my surprise when a very large cardboard box turned up on my doorstep, bearing SIX tins of the stuff. And my twisted sense of responsibility (hi mom!) resulted in my feeling obliged to give it a try.
(According to my kid brother, my swearing could be heard from the other end of our property)
Along with these 6 cans of flavoured tomatoes came a ‘handy’ recipe book, which held suggestions on how I should use these gifts. This book, titled ‘Italian Style Classics: 20 Italian recipes made simple with Ardmona Rich & Thick Italian Style Range”, was under the impression that a tin of flavoured tomatoes, carrot, potatoes, kidney beans and sausages constituted a minestrone.
At this point, I would like to interrupt myself with a very public letter to SPC Ardmona:
Dear Sirs/Madams:
I understand that you are under the impression that many people these days live busy lives and can’t be bothered making home-cooked meals. When I see the number of people at work who purchase and bring instant noodles / frozen lasagnas / tinned soup etc, I get a little of that impression myself.
However, please do not equate people being time-poor with being stupid .
While I have no real problem with your actual product (other than the sodium content on some of this stuff – WOWSERS), this recipe book that was so considerately provided is an insult to the intelligence of myself and every other person who knows something about their food.
Meaning that your minestrone recipe is missing the onion and celery. And that’s just for starters.
Kind regards,
Ellie the Kitchen Wench
Which brings me to my next point.
From the flavours of this range that I tasted, I can honestly say that none of them disgusted me (but bear in mind that I had looked at the sodium content of these products BEFORE seasoning the food and thus was able to avoid saltiness). But, on the other hand, none of them actually impressed me either.
When we cook and create in our kitchens, there are a number of things that are happening. Primarily, we are cooking to sate hunger. But what we are also doing is learning, refining and developing our own tastes and palates. When you discover that a recipe does not have to be followed religiously and begin to tweak it slightly to suit your tastes, that is when you start to learn. What happens if you omit an ingredient, or replace it with something else? What elements can be substituted for others, which elements need to remain to keep the true flavour of the dish?
When we eat food which has been flavoured / seasoned / created by a manufacturer, what we are actually doing is allowing this manufacturer to tell us the way that THEY believe a certain dish should taste.
Have you ever made minestrone soup from scratch? Or are you only familiar with the kind that comes from a can?
If it’s the latter, I ask that you try making it yourself. Trust me, the taste is more than worth the effort – plus you can count it as another step on the journey to become a kitchen god or goddess
Minestrone Soup
(adapted from a recipe by chef Shaun Hill in The Cook’s Book )
A minestrone should be quite thick and rich rather than watery with a few garnishes swimming in translucent broth. The vegetables and herbs used aren’t strict either – feel free to substitute the parsley with sweet basil, add asparagus, zucchini (courgettes), peas, beans…its up to you!
Ingredients
1 onion, finely diced
1 small leek, finely sliced
1 celery stick, finely diced
1 carrot, finely diced
2 rashers of bacon, diced
1/2 a small Savoy cabbage, coarsely chopped (makes about 1 1/2 – 2 cups)
1 small potato, peeled and finely diced
1 cup cooked or tinned chickpeas
3-4 tbsp tinned diced tomato / tomato passata
1.5L chicken stock
20g small pasta (I used risoni purely because I had it in my pantry)
Optional: Parsley & sliced / grated Parmesan cheese to serve
1. Prepare your ingredients by chopping everything into a fine dice and set them aside for now.
The basis of this dish is formed by a mirepoix (a combination of onion, celery and carrot in a traditional ratio of 2:1:1 – though I also like to add leek to replace one ratio of onion), so please try and make sure that these vegetables are diced quite neatly.
2. You also need about 3-4 tbsp of tinned diced tomatoes, so make sure that this is ready on hand. Heat up a little oil in a large pot, then add the onion, leek, celery, carrot and bacon and saute till the onions are translucent and cooked (but before they begin to turn golden and take on colour). At this stage, you should also add any additional leafy vegetables you would like to add to the dish – I find that diced silverbeet (chard) or savoy cabbage makes a very nice addition.
3. Once the carrot has begun to soften, add the tinned tomatoes, diced potato and chickpeas to the pot.
4. Make sure to stir well to ensure that everything is thoroughly mixed together, season with salt and pepper, then pour in your chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the pasta, then bring it to a boil once again, then reduce the heat and gently simmer for 10-15 minutes.
At this point you should have a delightfully rich and hearty soup, which can be garnished with chopped parsley/basil and Parmesan, and should definitely be served with some crusty bread!
A few notes about this dish:
You can make a vegetarian version of this dish by either replacing the bacon with Facon (soy ‘bacon’) or omitting it altogether, and replacing the chicken stock with vegetable stock (preferable) or water.
This soup actually freezes quite well if you omit the pasta. Measure out individual serves into ziploc bags, then carefully seal up (make sure you get rid of as much air from inside the bag as possible. When you think you want to have some, either pull a bag out of the freezer and place it into the fridge the night before to thaw out, or just place the whole bag into a pot of simmering water – which will take it straight from frozen to reheated!
Crusty bread for this dish is a must! When I have a hearty soup such as this, one of my favourite accompaniments is one or two slices of baguette which are then toasted, rubbed with a RAW garlic clove then spread with a little salted butter. You’ll definitely want to have some gum handy for the intense garlic breath, but if you’re a garlic fiend like myself, you’ll be in sweet sweet stinky-breath heaven!
How do you like to make your minestrone soup? Do you have a recipe which has been passed on through generations and is time-tested, or have you got one that you’ve just made up as you go along? Please share your thoughts on this post in the comments below and let me know what you think

February  5, 2004 Salade Figue et Poire à la Bresaola
[Fig and Pear Salad with Bresaola]
While planning the menu for our Saturday night dinner party, I realized I hardly ever serve salad as a first course . I'll often use salad to accompany the star item, like a tartlet or a bruschetta or a mousse or a slice of terrine or what-have-you, but it is rarely a salad in its own right. I'm sorry.
I guess this is because salads don't sound like they'll be much fun to prepare : they're pretty easy, it's just a lot of ingredient preparation before the final tossing-together. But this time, I reflected that they can be nicely colorful and light , a fresh and satisfying opener served with good bread. And the added value is really in the pairing ideas , so I decided to explore that route, and composed this fig and pear salad with bresaola.
The idea came from a sandwich I recently ate at Cojean , a trendy healthy fast-food place that serves deliciously fresh products. It's one of my absolute faves for a quick lunch, and I have written a review for Bonjour Paris (Note : it is in the premium content area of the site, for which you need a subscription, but I encourage you to consider getting one : it will open the door to a wealth of interesting and witty articles -- and there is a money-back guarantee if you don't like it).
Last time I had lunch there, in addition to my delicious spelt and green bean salad with hazelnuts , I enjoyed a mini-sandwich of fresh fig, pear, bresaola, and Fourme d'Ambert, on a loaf of whole-wheat walnut bread. Bresaola is an Italian specialty of dried beef, lean and moist, cut in paper-thin slices ; Fourme d'Ambert is a blue cheese from Auvergne. It was excellent, and the idea stuck in my mind, to be transformed into this salad. I substituted mozzarella for the Fourme d'Ambert though, because I thought blue cheese was a little too sharp for the ensemble.
This salad turned out pretty and tasty, and I loved the way the different elements came together : sweetness from the fig and pear, saltiness from the bresaola strips, mellow and tender mozzarella, crunchy slightly bitter walnuts, and tangily dressed greens.
We served it with fresh baguette, or more precisely the beautiful fresh heart-shaped baguettes the Boulangépicier makes for Valentine's Day this year!
Salade Figue et Poire à la Bresaola
- 1 ripe and juicy pear
- 3 ripe figs
- 150 g mozzarella di bufala (incomparably tastier - but pricier - than the cow's milk one)
- 4 slices of bresaola
- 2 Tbsp chopped nuts
- 4 large handfuls (about 100 g) mixed spring greens
For the dressing :
- 1Tbsp walnut oil
- 1Tbsp olive oil
- 1Tbsp balsamic vinegar
- herbes de Provence
- salt, pepper
(Serves 4.)
Prepare the dressing by whisking together all the dressing ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside.
Wash and dry the greens . Cut the figs in quarters. Slice the mozarella , and cut some of the slices to get twelve roughly equal pieces. Cut the bresaola slices in rectangular strips. You can prepare these elements ahead, and store them for a few hours, covered, in the refrigerator.
Cut the pear in quarters, core and peel them. Slice each quarter in four slices. (This has to be done at the last minute to prevent the pear flesh from getting brown. You could cut the pear ahead too and splash the slices with lemon juice, but I didn't want lemon juice in this salad.)
Plating . Set out the four serving plates on the counter. On each plate, deposit a handful of greens. Set three pieces of mozzarella on top. Arrange a fourth of the bresaola strips and pear slices on top, in a star formation. Balance three fig quarters on top, and sprinkle with a few chopped nuts.
Use a small spoon to drizzle dressing all around the plate and on the salad.
Serve with fresh baguette or walnut bread.

December 17, 2003 Bruschetta
I remember very well the first bruschetta I ever had, served at the San Francisco vegetarian restaurant "Herbivore". We had arrived in the US about two months before, it was the night of my 21st birthday , we were with our friend Jérémie, and after dinner we went to see Arling & Cameron play. The barman wouldn't give me a free drink even considering the occasion, but we had the artists sign their album's poster for me, which sure made up for it. A very good birthday night indeed.
We enjoyed bruschetta so much that we kept ordering it whenever the occasion arose. But as much as bruschetta is a common appetizer in Californian restaurants, I have very rarely seen it served in France, so I had been in bruschetta withdrawal for quite a while.
The other night, I was coming home from work on the bus, wondering what to make for dinner, like a good 80% of my fellow passengers I'm sure. I was mentally probing the contents of our fridge and pantry, when the happy thought dawned on me that I had all the ingredients to make bruschetta. Or my version of it, at least.
Bruschetta
- a 30 cm (12'') section of baguette
- two large tomatoes
- one small onion
- a handful of fresh basil
- three cloves of garlic
- 1/3 C grated or crumbled cheese (I used parmesan on half the pieces, and a herbed sheep's milk cheese on the other)
- olive oil
- salt, pepper, piment d'espelette (substitute red pepper flakes)
(Serves 2.)
Halve the tomatoes, remove the seeds and the juice, and cut them in small dice . Peel and dice the onion. Chop the basil leaves. If you have a garlic press, squish two of the cloves. If you don't , peel them and chop them finely.
Put the tomatoes, onion, basil and garlic in a bowl . Add a little olive oil, salt, pepper and piment d'espelette to taste. If you have time, cover and let rest in the fridge for a few hours or overnight, so the flavors can meld.
Cut the baguette in half, then slice each half lengthwise. Toast the bread pieces in the toaster or the oven. Cut the last garlic clove in two halves. Rub the moist sides of the clove halves on the bread, and brush a little olive oil. Distribute the tomato mixture evenly between the four pieces, and sprinkle cheese on top.
Put the bruschetta pieces under the broiler for 5 to 10 minutes, until the cheese starts to melt. Serve immediately, with a mesclun salad.
This was a delicious weeknight dinner : quick to make, very pretty, and what could be more satisfying than garlicky crusty bread, melty cheese, and flavorful tomatoes, eaten with your fingers? Of course, it would also make a very nice opener, or even finger food, if cut into bite-size pieces.

October  1, 2004 Oeuf à la Coque, Mouillettes Rouges
[Soft-Boiled Egg, Red Pesto Bread Fingers]
The Oeuf à la Coque * : one of the simplest pleasures in life.
It is the easiest thing to make  -- although believe it or not, I have to ask Maxence every time how long the egg should be boiled for -- and conveniently single-serving if you want it to be.
It is fun to crack and pop its little hat open, and it is also the best companion to a few mouillettes. Mouillettes? Yes, those little fingers of toasted bread, a small set of edible cutlery with which to stir, mop and thoroughly enjoy the inside of your egg.
Mouillettes are traditionally spread with butter (preferably salted), but the concept is more than open to variations, and you should absolutely feel free to dress your mouillettes with whatever apparel strikes your fancy -- eggs are such easy-to-please, lenient little fellows.
The Oeuf à la Coque is also, undoubtedly, the king of egg dishes. I mean, what other egg dish requires the use of its own little throne, the royal Coquetier , giving me the occasion and joy of whipping out my designer egg cup , complete with matching spoon and integrated salt dispenser?
[ * Pronounced "uff-ah-la-cock" -- pardon my French.]
Oeuf à la Coque, Mouillettes Rouges -- my way
- 1 Tbsp pesto rouge
- 1 slice of sandwich-type bread
- 1 egg, preferably at room-temperature
- salt, pepper
(Serves me.)
Bring water to a slow boil in a saucepan. Gently lower the egg into the water. Count four minutes ( "quatre minutes, c'est bien ça Maxence?" ), then remove the egg from the water.
In the meantime, toast the slice of bread, and spread it generously with pesto rouge. Cut the slice of bread into fingers , thin enough to be easily inserted into the egg, but large enough to stay upright.
Sit the egg snugly into an egg cup, tap it gently all around the top with a knife, then slice off the hat that you have thus loosened. Sprinkle salt and pepper onto the inside of the hat and into the egg. Scrape out the inside of the hat with a spoon, eat that.
Take one of your mouillettes , dip it in, and eat the yolk-coated end. Repeat until all mouillettes have given up the fight. Go back to your good old spoon, and scoop out the remaining bits of egg white that line the shell. Enjoy the unique sensation of that spoon scraping against the shell.
Smack your lips and put the empty hat into the empty egg shell, for good luck -- can't bury a king without his crown , can you?

October 27, 2009 Jerusalem Artichoke Soup with Bacon
[Velouté de topinambours au bacon]
It has been a while -- five years, to be exact -- since we last discussed Jerusalem artichokes around here, but they do belong to my regular winter vegetable rotation so I thought I'd bring them up again.
The tubers have just started to appear and will stick around until March or April, so you can start looking for them now; you should have better luck finding them at a farmers' market of some sort, as they are not exactly a mainstream lot. The variety that's available in France is pink-skinned (see picture below), but you may see them wearing a beige outfit in your part of the world, and no one could blame you for being a bit envious then.
As I mentioned last time , the topinambour is a typical example of what the French call légumes oubliés , or forgotten vegetables. It's an umbrella term that includes heirloom varieties that have gone by the wayside in favor of hardier/more productive/glossier ones, but also those vegetables our grandparents resorted to eating during World War II, despite their cattle fodder status, because the more palatable options were commandeered and rationed (see post on my grandmother's war ration stamps ). Among those, our friend the Jerusalem artichoke and its little buddy the rutabaga (a.k.a. Swede), on which our grandparents swiftly turned their back after the war, because of the memories they conjured.
But the topinambour is now back in style (that gum you like, too) and it's a good thing, for it is a truly delicious vegetable with a distinctive artichoke-like flavor, and a creamy texture similar to that of baking potatoes.
This means they're perfect soup material : they'll turn to velvet when cooked in stock and blitzed with a blender, making the French word velouté a fitting descriptor for the resulting dish. I sometimes pair Jerusalem artichokes with mushrooms or apples in soups, but here I've decided to cook them with bacon , adding a smoky umami dimension that tickles the delicate sweetness of the tubers. A sprinkle of snipped chives for clarity, and you've got yourself a rustic, yet subtle soup that you can serve with long fingers of day-old, toasted baguette.
Aside from using Jerusalem artichokes in soup, I like to braise or roast them; I also mash them like potatoes and garnish the purée with chopped hazelnuts to serve with rabbit or game; I add them along with parsnips to gratin dauphinois ; I use them in risotti or frittate with mushrooms and leafy greens; I add them warm to salads of mâche and walnuts... I have yet to try them raw (carpaccio-style) or fried (in chips), but I hear that works well, too.
Because it seems disingenuous to talk about Jerusalem artichokes and not broach the delicate subject of digestion , here we go: Jerusalem artichokes can be, um, difficult to process. The blame is generally placed on inulin , a type of fiber that these tubers contain, and to which most (though not all) people are sensitive, as Tamara Duker explains in more detail . This helps explain why our grandparents were so eager to banish them.
But we've established that Jerusalem artichokes are otherwise excellent for your taste buds and your health (see Tamara's post again), so I've done a little reading and I've identified three tips that seem to help significantly. I readily admit that, short of conducting a comparative chemical and physiological study, they are merely suggestions of what has worked in my kitchen, but I trust that someone with more lab time on his hands will one day get to the bottom of it (sorry, a bad pun was bound to be made at some point).
The first tip, and the most important one I think, is to get the freshest Jerusalem artichokes you can -- they should feel firm and tight-skinned -- and to cook them within a day or two. It is counterintuitive, since they're root vegetables and we tend to think of those as fit for long storage, but the molecular structure in all vegetables continues to evolve after they're picked, and it seems to be the case here. So, buy them fresh, and use them fast.
Secondly, their effect is alleviated if they're parboiled first: start them in cold water, add baking soda for good luck, bring to a simmer, then drain and toss the cooking water, before you go on with the rest of the recipe. Lastly, they seem to fare much better in combination with potatoes -- something about an enzyme in the potatoes that would help break down the infamous inulin -- and because the universe is cleverly designed, they happen to be a fine flavor match, too.
Do you have favorite Jerusalem artichoke recipes, or tricks of your own, to share?
Jerusalem Artichoke Soup with Bacon
- 1.2 kg (2 1/2 pounds) Jerusalem artichokes
- 1 medium floury potato (i.e. one you'd use for mashing), about 200 grams (7 ounces)
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 100 grams (3 1/2 ounces) bacon *, diced or cut into matchsticks
- 1 clove garlic , roughly chopped
- 1 liter (4 cups) vegetable or chicken stock , preferably unsalted, hot (if you don't have quite enough stock on hand, make up for the difference using water)
- freshly ground black pepper
- a small bunch fresh chives , snipped, for garnish
Serves 4 to 6.
Peel the Jerusalem artichokes with a vegetable peeler**, placing the peeled ones in a bowl of cold water as you work, to prevent oxydation. Don't worry about getting all the skin off; it doesn't matter if tiny patches remain in hard-to-reach nooks. Peel the potato as well.
Rinse the Jerusalem artichokes and potato in one or two changes of water, cut them into chunks (about 3 cm or 1 inch in width) and place them in a medium saucepan. Cover with cold water, add the baking soda, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. As soon as the water simmers, remove from heat and reserve in the cooking water.
While the vegetables are heating up, place a soup pot over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until browned. A minute before the bacon is entirely browned, add the garlic and cook for a minute until softened, stirring frequently to avoid coloring.
Drain the vegetables and add them to the soup pot. Pour in the hot stock, stir, and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook for 15 to 18 minutes, until the vegetables are cooked enough that a knife can be easily inserted through them, but not so much that they fall apart.
Put on an apron and purée the soup using an immersion blender. Taste and add a little salt if necessary (but bacon is already quite salty, so I find it's unnecessary). Divide among soup plates, sprinkle with black pepper and chives, and serve.
* If you wanted to make a vegetarian approximation of the soup, you could try starting it with olive oil and flavor it with smoked paprika instead.
** Some have told me they don't peel Jerusalem artichokes, but rather brush them clean. This certainly saves time, but the skin, however pinkish, does not look very appetizing to me, and I'd worry about finding little grey bits in the finished dish.

Reviews for Alaskan Halibut Cioppino
3.7 out of 5
3 total review(s)
Ingredients: 1/4 cup canola oil
4 halibut fillets, each about 4 oz., skin removed
Extra-fine French grey sea salt, to taste
1/2 cup thinly sliced yellow onion
10 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 cup torn oyster mushrooms
1 cup thinly sliced fennel
1 cup diced butternut squash (1/2-inch dice)
2 cups diced tomatoes (1/4-inch dice)
1 tsp. fennel seed
1 cup dry red wine
1 cup water
1 Tbs. bay seafood seasoning
1/2 lb. Manila clams
1/2 lb. mussels
1/2 lb. large shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails intact
1/4 cup olive oil
2 Tbs. chiffonade of fresh flat-leaf parsley (very thinly sliced)
4 sprigs fennel fronds
Directions: In an 11-inch square griddle pan over medium heat, warm 2 Tbs. of the canola oil. Season the halibut fillets with French grey sea salt. Place the fish, skinned side up, in the pan and sear until golden, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a platter.
Return the griddle to medium heat and warm the remaining 2 Tbs. canola oil. Add the onion, garlic, mushrooms, fennel and squash and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, 8 to 10 minutes; do not allow them to brown. Add the tomatoes and fennel seed and cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the wine and stir to scrape up the browned bits from the pan bottom. Add the water and bay seafood seasoning and bring the mixture to a simmer.
Add the clams to the pan and simmer briskly until they start to open, 10 to 12 minutes, then move them to the edges. Place the halibut, seared side up, in the center of the pan, and arrange the mussels and shrimp around the edges. Continue to cook, occasionally basting the fish with the broth, until the mussels open, the shrimp turn pink and opaque, and the halibut is cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes. Discard any clams and mussels that did not open. Drizzle the olive oil over the halibut, sprinkle with the parsley and fennel fronds, and serve immediately. Serves 4.

April 27, 2005 Parmentier de Hareng Fumé aux Brocolis
[Smoked Herring and Broccoli Parmentier]
In France, we get pretty much the same télé-réalité shows as everywhere else in the Western world -- yet another perk of globalization -- but I don't often watch them, as I find most either really boring or really painful to watch.
However, I have somehow let myself get sucked into the current show called La Nouvelle Star -- the French rendition of American Idol -- in which successive selections lead to the discovery of the best new singing talent. I can't explain how this happened, really, but Stéfan, Patricia (my dear neighbor-friends) and I have developped an inexplicable interest in the competition, turning this weekly event into an occasion to share a casual dinner and dish about the candidates, the judges and various other topics, nouvelle-star-related or not.
This little Thursday night ritual is usually conducted at their place -- I wouldn't want to impose this upon Maxence, who cannot understand what in the world has gotten into us -- and Stéphan does most of the cooking, with his usual talent. But he was out of town last week, so I told Patricia that I would gladly be the interim chef for our nouvelle-star viewing, and I made us this Herring and Broccoli Parmentier , the inspiration for which came to me during my metro ride home.
Parmentier , or hachis parmentier , is a traditional French dish of ground meat (usually beef, sometimes a mix of beef and pork) topped with mashed potatoes and oven-baked. It is named in honor of Antoine Parmentier, the 18th century agronome we have to thank for promoting the potato as a vegetable fit for human consumption. Depending on whom you talk to, hachis parmentier is either a blissful comfort food or a horrid school cafeteria memory. It is considered very humble fare and is mostly reserved to home cooking or very basic restaurants -- it is a notorious way to use up leftover meat -- but you can occasionally see it featured on fancier restaurant menus as a twist on the classic recipe, using a more noble kind of meat or even fish. (For a little more on the history of the dish, let me point you to my recipe for Duck Confit Parmentier on the Bonjour Paris website.)
This Parmentier variation -- admittedly getting further and further from the original concept, but I'm sure Antoine won't mind -- substitutes smoked herring (a.k.a. kipper) for the meat and broccoli for the potatoes. I love smoked herring and the intense flavor it lends to a dish, but it can easily be overpowering: here the mashed broccoli provides a light blanket that complements and tones it down.
But sadly, Francine got kicked out. She was my favorite. I am utterly disconsolate.
Parmentier de Hareng Fumé aux Brocolis
- 2 medium heads broccoli, about 1 kg (2 lbs.)
- 250 g (9 oz) fillets of smoked herring (a.k.a. kipper -- substitute another kind of smoked fish, provided it is sold in fillets, not thin slices)
- 1 1/2 C of milk (optional, to de-salt the herring if needed)
- 1/3 C crème fraîche (substitute heavy or sour cream)
- 1/4 C fresh breadcrumbs (unseasoned)
- pepper
(Serves 4 as a main dish, 6 as a first course.)
If you are using salted herring fillets, they need to be desalted: put them in a dish, cover with milk and let rest for at least 3 hours or overnight in the refrigerator. Drain, rinse with water and pat dry before using.
Clean, trim and boil the broccoli florets until soft (but not falling apart). Drain thoroughly. Add in the crème fraîche and mash with a potato masher or a fork, until it forms a chunky purée. Season with pepper but very little to no salt, as the herring contains a fair amount.
Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
Cut the herring in half-inch chunks, and arrange them in an even layer at the bottom of a medium baking dish. Top with the broccoli purée, flattening the surface with a spatula, and sprinkle with breadcrumbs. (Alternately, line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and reproduce this layering in serving circles, to make individual servings as pictured above.)
Put into the oven to bake for twenty minutes or so, until it is thoroughly heated and the breadcrumbs have turned golden. Serve immediately.

Blue Cheese Biscuits 48 comments - 02.13.2011
I have a bad habit of reading cookbooks while I’m eating, if I’m alone at home. I like flipping through the pages and looking at pictures, but the downside is that too often I get so excited about a recipe that I don’t even finish dinner and head over to the kitchen and start pulling out the tubs of flour and sugar. To avoid malnutrition, I finally decided that I should just bookmark recipes that look interesting to me and get back to them later.
Quite a while back, I’d bookmarked the recipe for Galettes au Roquefort in Mastering the Art of French Cooking just because these finger-sized crisps sounded so good and the recipe looked so darned simple. Plus I loved the idea of crisp, savory biscuits with the sharp tang of blue cheese in them. Unfortunately I now have a rather imposing stack of cookbooks with recipes bookmarked in them, and as the stack grew, this one moved farther and farther down the pile.
However while I’m nearly finishing As Always, Julia , a compilation of her correspondence when she lived in Europe, I decided once and for all to tackle the teetering pile of cookbooks, and the recipe, and give them a try.
The result was worth the wait and although the dough looked pretty standard as I was putting it together and rolling it out, when baked, the flat circles rose up and became light and flaky little circles of buttery biscuits. These galettes are puff pastry-like, and Julia Child calls them “featherweight”, which is pretty right-on. (As she usually was.) I added a bit of red pepper powder to spice ‘em up as well as some chopped fresh thyme and a bit of salt, which I don’t think she would have minded at all.
I should warn you that when you beat the blue cheese to a paste, it looks somewhat unappetizing—a steely green-gray mash, and if someone showed me a picture of it , I would not have known what it was. But that dissipates when you add the rest of the ingredients and the biscuits are a warm burnished brown when baked, masking their unfortunately colored past.
The dough is slightly sticky, and may require a bit more flour than you think when rolling them out. You don’t need to go overboard, but add enough to keep the dough from sticking, and turn it constantly to make sure it’s not getting welded to the counter. While cooking, the biscuits will puff up a bit and some will exude bits of sizzling fromage bleu , thanks to all the cheese packed in them. Which doesn’t bother me in the least. In fact, I save those ones just for me.
Blue Cheese Biscuits
About forty bite-sized biscuits
Adapted from Mastering the Art of French Cooking by Julia Child, Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle
The biscuits should be cooked until the tops are nicely browned for the best flavor. These biscuits should be served the day they’re baked but the dough can be refrigerated up to three days in advance or frozen for at least two months. Child advises the biscuits can be baked and frozen, then “…reheated for 5 minutes or so in a hot oven.”
4 ounces (115g) blue cheese or Roquefort, at room temperature
4 ounces (115g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 tablespoons (30ml) heavy cream or sour cream
1 large egg yolk
3/4 cup (110g) flour
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/3 teaspoon red chili pepper
optional: 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme
egg wash: 1 egg beaten with 1 teaspoon water
1. In a bowl of a stand mixer, or by hand using a fork mash the cheese.
2. Mix in the butter, heavy or sour cream, and egg yolk.
3. Stir in the flour, salt, chili powder, and thyme (if using), mixing until smooth.
4. Gather the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic, and chill the dough for a few hours, until firm.
5. To bake the biscuits, preheat the oven to 400ºF (200ºC). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, or use non-stick baking sheets.
6. Roll the dough on a floured surface until about 1/4-inch (1/2 cm) thick. Use a cookie cutter (mine was 1 3/4″, 5cm, but you can use other sizes) to cut the biscuits, then set them evenly spaced apart on a baking sheet. Brush the tops with a bit of egg wash.
7. Bake the biscuits for 10 to 15 minutes, rotating the baking sheets midway during baking. When the biscuits have puffed a bit and the tops are well-browned, remove them from the oven and cool the trays on a wire rack.
Note : Julia Child gives completely separate recipes in her book for biscuits made with firmer cheeses, like Gruyère and Comté , and those using very soft cheeses, like Camembert, Brie , or Liederkranz. So it’s not recommended to try this particular recipe with other cheeses.

Cherries in Red Wine Syrup 63 comments - 07.08.2010
Where did the time go? I wanted to get one quick cherry recipe in before the season ended because I’m always scouting for ways to extend the unfairly short fresh cherry season. Plus I had some red wine leftover from another cooking project, a bulging sack of ripe cherries that the vendors were practically begging me to take off their hands (I know…it was kind of freaking me out, too), and a desire to make them last as long as I can.
So here’s how they ended up: in a compote that’s incredibly easy to make with the spiciness of red wine, a touch of vinegar to add a little je ne sais quoi , and a few minutes of stovetop cooking to transform them into sticky-sweet orbs with the concentrated flavor of summer cherries.
The good thing is that at the end of the season, they are practically giving away cherries at my market and if you’ve got the time to pit ‘em, then more cherries for you wait as a reward.
You can use any kind of red wine. Contrary to popular thinking, I don’t think you need to use a decent wine for this; even the super cheap stuff will work. The merlot I used cost a whopping €2.30 a bottle. I’m not sure why people tell you to use top-quality wine for cooking, especially when you’re going to be reducing it to a syrup, because there’s plenty of inexpensive wines that taste just fine to me and are perfect for projects like this.
Just try to find one that’s full and fruity, like pinot noir, Zinfandel, or Beaujolais.
Those wines are especially good when paired with cherries and when it’s cooked down, often have a little bit of the aforementioned spiciness to them. That said, if you want to add a few spices—a stick or two of cinnamon, some ground allspice or cloves, you can certainly do so. Just go easy on them; since you’re making a reduction, any spices will get concentrated and you really want the cherries to star in this compote.
Being a purist, I don’t often thicken fruit sauces, preferring to let the fruit juices and pulp mingle with the sugar and let them thicken on their own. However I did add a bit of starch, which makes the sauce ever-so-slightly more substantial, but I don’t add enough so you’ll detect it in the compote. You can leave it out if you prefer.
For a few other ways to preserve the cherry crop, check out No-Recipe Cherry Jam and Quick Candied Cherries . These super simple to make cherries are easily mixed into a summer fruit salad, served alongside grilled pork or chicken, as a topping for Vanilla Ice Cream , or even alongside warm Caramelized White Chocolate Cakes or another favorite chocolate dessert.
Happy pitting!
Cherries in Red Wine Syrup
Makes 2 cups (500g)
I used bright-red sweet cherries, but feel free to mix in some of the multi-hued varieties, such as Queen Anne (incongruously called ‘Napoléon’ cherries in France) and Ranier. If you can get sour cherries, a mix of those with the sweet ones is cherry paradise.
1 pound (450g) fresh cherries, stemmed and pitted
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (130g) sugar
1 1/4 cups (310ml) red wine
2 teaspoons corn starch or potato starch
2 tablespoons red wine or 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
optional: 1/2 tablespoon kirsch
1. Put the cherries and sugar in a large, wide saucepan.
2. Mix one tablespoon of the red wine with the corn or potato starch in a small bowl until it’s dissolved and set aside.
3. Add the rest of the wine and the vinegar to the saucepan. Bring the heat up to a boil, then reduce the heat so it’s at a low boil and cook, stirring frequently, for about 12 minutes, until the cherries are completely wilted and softened through.
4. During the last moments of cooking, stir in the starch slurry and let the mixture boil the additional minute or so, to thicken the juices.
5. Turn off the heat and stir in the almond extract and kirsch, if using.
Storage: The cherries will keep up to one week in the refrigerator. They can be frozen for up to six months.

Mint Chip Ice Cream 127 comments - 05.31.2010
One of my favorite summertime memories was having mint chip ice cream back when I grew up in New England, which we ate outside and had ordered from a window at our local dairy. Even though the ice cream was freshly made, they made sure it bright-bright-green, so we knew we were eating mint, I guess.
I remember a few years later, after the dairy closed, when we bought a tub of Breyers ‘all-natural’ ice cream at the supermarket and I lifted the lid off the tub of mint chip ice cream only to be surprised to find that mint ice cream wasn’t really green at all, but almost pure, snowy white, save for the chunks of chocolate studded about here and there.
When I wanted to come up with my own mint ice cream recipe, I used handfuls of fresh mint leaves for flavor, unlike what the store-bought stuff is made from, so it had a leafy, herbaceous flavor. A few people noted to me at various times that their mint-infused milk didn’t get the delicate green hue that mine has, but mint is a plant and most plants aren’t standardized—at least not the ones I want to eat.
So, naturally there will be variations in strength and color depending on the mint that you use. If you’d prefer to have absolute certain, 100% standardized results, you could simply make a plain vanilla ice cream and add mint extract or crème de menthe in lieu of the vanilla, but I’ll stick to using only fresh mint in my ice cream.
I cook and bake—and make ice cream, because I like to do it. And it’s interesting reading lately around the internet that eating and cooking has become a bloodsport to some degree. I was reading a few sites where people talk about food and saw how analytical people are when it comes to picking apart recipes and techniques: detailed  spreadsheets, line-by-line comparisons, and heated debates of various proportions, down to the last ¼ teaspoon, are dissected.
The whole mélange of everyone adding their two cents makes things interesting, I suppose, but reading through some of that stuff gives me brain freeze. I love talking about food, and writing about it. But I’m happiest when I pull up to the table with friends, and enjoy a good meal or a dish of ice cream. The reason I enjoyed working in professional kitchens, especially at Chez Panisse , was because the cooks I worked with were just interested in serving the best food we could. That, I think, is the objective of every cook, whether they’re cooking at home, or professionally.
I loved writing my ice cream book, The Perfect Scoop , because when I worked in the restaurant kitchen, my very favorite things to do was to make ice cream. I found ice cream to be a perfect backdrop for playing around with a whole bunch of flavors, not just chocolate and vanilla. And it seems everyone loves ice cream, including me.
Mint Chip is truly one of my fondest flavors, to this day, and this batch I recently churned up at home reconfirmed that. I could barely stop myself from taking copious samples as I was folding in the melted chocolate to make the crunchy little chocolate chips.
The French don’t have many chocolate-mint desserts in their repertoire (maybe we need a few Girl Scouts peddling cookies!) but at the outdoor markets, Arabic vendors sell huge bunches of fresh mint, which folks use to make mint tea and tabbouli . They’re cheap, too; normally just 30 or 40 centimes per bunch. Of course, you have to put up with being jostled by the remarkably resilient women who are certain there is a better bunch located somewhere near the bottom of the stack (and always seem to be right where I happen to be standing…), that has an additional branch or a few more mint leaves on them, than the forty-nine bunches of mint on top of the pile.
Feel free to improvise and fold in any kind of chocolate chips you want, or go a little wild and add about two cups of chopped thin mints or crumbled brownies instead of making the chocolate chips with melted chocolate. One tip: When you melt the chocolate, make sure the bowl is clean and dry; any moisture or water will cause the chocolate to seize and harden. And if that happens, you’ll miss out on the fun of drizzling the chocolate and stirring them to make the homemade chips.
Mint Chip Ice Cream
Makes about 1 quart (1l)
Adapted from The Perfect Scoop (Ten Speed Press)
The bright taste of fresh mint is marvelous with the little bits of bittersweet chocolate. If you are unsure of the quantity of mint leaves, weigh them to the get the exact amount. I just stuck a few mint springs in my rooftop garden box and within a week, they took root and are thriving nicely. It’s not enough to make a batch of mint ice cream quite yet, so for now, I’m buying my mint at the market. Depending on where you shop, you might want to buy two bunches, to make sure you have enough.
For the mint ice cream:
1 cup (250 ml) whole milk
3/4 cup (150 g) sugar
2 cups (500 ml) heavy cream
pinch of salt
2 cups packed (80 gr) fresh mint leaves
5 large egg yolks
For the chocolate chips:
5 ounces (140 gr) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped
1. In a medium saucepan, warm the milk, sugar, 1 cup (250 ml) heavy cream, salt, and mint.
2. Once the mixture is hot and steaming, remove from heat, cover, and let stand for an hour to infuse the mint flavor.
3. Remove the mint with a strainer, then press down with a spatula firmly to extract as much mint flavor and color as possible. (You can also use well-washed hands to do it as well, making sure the mixture isn’t too hot to safely handle.) Once the flavor is squeezed out, discard the mint.
4. Pour the remaining heavy cream into a large bowl and set the strainer over the top.
5. Rewarm the infused milk. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, then slowly pour some of the warm mint mixture into the yolks, whisking constantly, then scrape the warmed yolks back into the saucepan.
6. Cook the custard, stirring constantly with a heatproof spatula, until the mixture thickens and coats the spatula. If using an instant read thermometer, it should read around 170ºF (77ºC).
7. Immediately strain the mixture into the cream, then stir the mixture over an ice bath until cool.
8. Refrigerate the mixture thoroughly, preferably overnight, then freeze it in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
While the mixture is freezing, melt the chocolate in a small bowl over a pot of simmering water, or in a microwave oven on low power, stirring until smooth. Place a storage container in the freezer.
9. When the ice cream in the machine is ready, scribble some of the chocolate into the container, then add a layer of the just-churned ice cream to the container. Scribble melted chocolate over the top of the ice cream, then quickly stir it in, breaking up the chocolate into irregular pieces. Continue layering the ice cream, scribbling more chocolate and stirring as you go.
When finished, cover and freeze until firm.

Sardine Pâté Recipe 58 comments - 07.19.2009
If we Americans are good at anything, it’s shopping. It’s in our genes and we were simply born to shop. And we’re also good at getting deals. I don’t think many people pay full-price for anything anymore, and unless something is discounted, we won’t buy it.
When I moved to France, folks were amazed at my ability to search out le deal. I felt silly going into the local papeterie and buying 8 sheets of paper for €4, when I could get a whole ream at Office Depot for about the same price. Except no one told the French Office Depot team that Office Depot is supposed to be a discount store, and after I took Romain to one in New York, where everything was essentially free, he was shocked, and said, “Office Depot in Paris is the last place you go if you need something.”
Nevertheless, I keep hearing about ‘recession-friendly’ prices and ‘budget-friendly’ budgets, and whatever. I’m a bit skeptical of the whole thing since someone in the states was telling me that they bought their new, jumbo flat-screen television online to save the tax, because they were trying to save some money. Um, and why are they buying a new jumbo flat-screen television then?
I guess I shouldn’t talk, though, because I’m a shopper, too.
If you saw my living room—which doubles as my kitchen, dining room, office, guest room, laundry room, and closet, there are piles of cookbooks everywhere. It’s a sickness, but I can’t help myself.
My Trippen shoe collection is legendary. And clothes? When I moved from the states, I realized I had 54 tank tops, 16 pairs of jeans, 209 socks, and a custom-made pair of leather jeans that someone I know who worked at a store specializing in bondage gear back in San Francisco made and fitted especially for me. Those I haven’t ever worn—but I will someday. (Although I might have waited too long, as there’s been a few too-many croissants between then and now.) But I did have to bring Romain into that only-in-San-Francisco place on a trip back, just for him to see it. And just for fun, they dressed him up in a head-to-toe latex outfit. Now that , my friends, was perhaps the funniest day of my life. But because I keep getting told that I should only talk about food, I’ll spare you the details.
One place where I don’t really economize is with food. Sure, I’ll look for a better prices on cherries at the market. But fruits and vegetables are usually cheapest when they’re plentiful and in season, so that seems natural. But if I’m going to buy beef, which is a rarity, I’ll go to a good butcher and spend the bucks. When I buy fish, I try to stick to those that are plentiful and sustainable. Which, happily, are the least-expensive fish on display. Although one should be wary of ‘cheap’ fish, like the ones that are on sale or those going around & around & around & around at the all-you-wanna-eat-help-yourself conveyor-belted sushi bars.
Because I’ve become Monsieur Responsable when it comes to buying and consuming fish, I’ve been trying to be more selective when choosing which critters to eat, in spite of the huge variety available here.
(I had dinner at Racines with Barbra the other night and I could tell we both wanted to order the cod with pommes écrasés , or “broken potatoes”, but we didn’t want to do it in front of the other. But the chicken I had was amazing. And I don’t know if she would’ve even noticed what I ordered anyways, with Pierre breezing around his restaurant all night in a snug white t-shirt. I was concerned the poor girl was going to wake up with whiplash the next day. I, on the other hand, was there for the food. I assure you.)
So I buy sardines, which are inexpensive and as tasty as Pierre, but without the tattoos. And best of all, they’re very good for you. I’ve seen Dorie Greenspan’s recipe for Sardine Pâté using tinned sardines, but I thought it would be cheaper to use the fresh ones. (Who’d of thought ‘fresh’ would be cheaper? Let’s hear it for France!) But wherever you live just ask your friendly fish merchant to prepare the sardines, and to clean off any scales.
And for all you “do-ahead” types, who make us “last-minute” types feels like bad planners, yes, this can be made ahead. In fact, it’s better if made the day before. And if you’re one of those “freezer-types”, well gosh darn it, yes , it can be frozen.
The whole she-bang shouldn’t cost you more than 2 bucks to put together, which makes it quite the bargain. And with all the money you save, you probably won’t be able to buy that flat-screen tv nor a form-fitting latex bodysuit, but you will be able to eat pretty well. And you can’t put a value on that.
(Although I may have to put one on those leather pants since at the rate I’m wearing them, they probably going to be on Craigslist.fr any day now.)
Sardine Pâté
About eight servings
I serve this with pita bread cut into triangles, brushed with olive oil, and toasted. But toasted rounds of baguette, or any cracker or flatbread would be perfect. One with rye or whole grain flour is especially recommended.
You can omit the chives and add some parsley or chervil. Scallions are rare in France, but finely-chopped, I think they’d be terrific in place of the shallots. Although this is a great spread along with an apéritif, I like it for lunch, with a salad.
8 whole sardines, cleaned and filleted (about 12 ounces, 350g)
salt and freshly-ground black pepper
2 shallots, peeled and minced
1/2 bunch of chives, minced
big pinch of chile powder
2 ounces (70g) butter, salted or unsalted, at room temperature
3 tablespoons olive oil
freshly-squeezed lemon juice
1. Preheat the oven to 350F (180C).
2. Arrange the sardines in the single layer in a baking dish, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and bake until just cooked, about eight minutes.
3. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature.
4. Pulse the sardines in a food processor, or mash them with a fork, along with the shallots, chives, chile powder, butter, and olive oil, until relatively smooth, but still a bit chunky.
5. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and taste, adjusting the seasonings to your liking.
6. Scrape the mixture into a small bowl and chill for at least eight hours, or overnight.
7. Let come to room temperature before serving.
Storage: Pâté can be kept in the refrigerator for up to three days, or frozen for up to one month.
Notes : In Paris, it’s fairly easy to find sardines cleaned and ready-to-go at the fishmonger. If you can’t, it’s not that difficult to do yourself. Here’s a pictorial on how-to fillet sardines .
It’s good idea to try to get any tough bones out of the sardines before mashing them in step #4. If any too-crunchy ones remain after you’ve made the pâté , spread the pâté on a cutting board and run over it a bunch of times with a chef’s knife to ensure they’re all in very, very small pieces. As the pâté rests, they’ll become imperceptible and in fact, are quite good for you as they have a lot of bone-building calcium.

Creamy Feta-Red Wine Vinegar Salad Dressing 61 comments - 01.22.2009
When I was a newbie, someone in the cookbook biz once told me that if a cookbook has one great recipe in it, it’s totally worth it. And I agree with that. I have a mountain of cookbooks, and most have plenty of tempting recipes but I’ve only made one thing from many of them. But those that do make the cut become standards—or what we call “ go to ” recipes.
One such cookbook was the Joy of Cooking , which was re-published with great fanfare (and some undeserved derision) in 1997. I remember a blurb on the book jacket from a previous edition, by a bride who swore she toted the book along when she moved abroad. Which I didn’t, although I was hardly a blushing bride. So at least I have an excuse.
My “go to” recipe from that book was the Feta Dressing . I think it was promoted as ‘healthy’, which certainly has some appeal. But what I liked most about it was that it had lots and lots of feta in it, one of my very favorite cheeses, and one of the most versatile. Feta is the cheese I go to when I want to crumble something over hot pasta, since the strong flavor holds up really well and as it warms up, the cheese turns into soft, salty cubes that play off whole wheat pasta particularly well. I like the pasta with stewed greens, garlic, and a heavy hand of chopped olives tossed in. Or even crumbled over pasta with pesto . Try it!
I’m also a big, big fan of winter greens, like frisée, Belgian endive, and escarole. And this dressing is thick enough to stand up to those tougher, slightly-bitter salads that I crave when the temperature drops.
I didn’t jot down this recipe when I did my transatlantic split, but it was pretty easy to re-create. The original had oregano in it, but I used thyme , since oregano and marjoram aren’t easily found, but fresh thyme always is.
(Maybe it’s all going into that marjoram-flavored diet water ?)
The dressing includes a good dose of red wine vinegar, but resist the temptation to use another one: the abrupt acidity of red wine vinegar gives the dressing its kick.
Creamy Feta-Red Wine Vinegar Dressing
Makes 3/4 cup (200ml)
Inspired by the Joy of Cooking
Feta is now protected and must be from Greece, and is made from sheep or goat’s milk. I pluck my feta out of the watery bins in Arab markets in France, and sometimes buy the real-deal or I choose a milder, similarly-crumbly, salted cheese, depending on what strikes my fancy at the moment. Other varieties, which can no longer be called feta , are made elsewhere and you can use what’s available.
I’ve made this dressing with dried oregano, too. If using dried, use half the amount called for. Be generous with the dressing when tossing the salad. I leave it chunky, because I like the texture (and it’s one less thing to wash), but it can also be pureed in a blender or food processor.
4 ounces (115g) feta cheese
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon finely-chopped fresh thyme or oregano
2 tablespoons flavorful olive oil
5 tablespoons water
salt and freshly-ground black pepper
1. Mash the feta with the vinegar and herbs with a fork until fairly smooth.
2. Mix in the olive oil and water, until smooth. Because feta cheese can vary in moisture, add more oil, vinegar, or water, if desired.
3. Season with pepper and salt, to taste.
Storage: This dressing will keep for four days in the refrigerator.
Other suggestions for this dressing:
A Caesar-ish salad with romaine lettuce, red onions, and garlic-heavy croutons.
Alongside tabbouleh.
Mashed with tinned tuna fish and chopped capers or green olives and scallions, for a twist on tuna salad.
Dressing for a plate of seasonal tomatoes with fresh oregano chopped and strewn over the top.
A mix of winter greens, tossed with slices of pears and toasted pecans.
Over grilled chicken breasts or tuna steaks.
WIth falafel!
As a dip, with toasted pita chips, radishes, or raw vegetables. Related Links and Recipes:

Inked Spaghetti with Seafood Filed under: pasta , seafood by: Tanantha P.
2.9.11
I'm sort of back.
Thank you for all the kind words and encouragement. You guys rock!
The I'm-not-in-the-mood-to-blog/cook moment happens to everyone, it seems like. At the end, we all go back to where we belong and are happy - cooking/baking. During the break, I dined out, traveled, read more books, and checked out inspiring blogs. All these things gave me motivation and energy.  My appetite is back, at least for now.
I hope everyone had a great Chinese New Year and super bowl.  I was happily full; that's all I can say!
I finally got around to this inked spaghetti I bought in Italy last October. Yeah..I know...I just got my hands on it now. The color makes a dramatic presentation and adds a wow factor to the finish. It's really easy, light, and elegant. This is my first time working on live mussels. Keith doesn't like them that much so I don't get a chance too often. However, for this type of spaghetti, it couldn't be better than with seafood. Keith doesn't like squid and scallops so he left me only a few options - shrimp and fish. I work for a shrimp importing company so they don't excite me that much. I decided to go with mussels and fish.
Please feel free to add any kind of seafood you like.
PS: I got really busy at work but I will catch up with my favorite blogs very soon!
Inked Spaghetti with Seafood
Yield: 4
Ingredients:
1 lbs live mussels, scrubbed and bearded
1 lbs fresh salmon, skinned, and cut to large cubes
3 tbs olive oil
7 tbs dry white wine
3 garlic cloves, chopped
2 tbs butter
1 lb inked spaghetti
3 tbs minced shallots
salt and pepper
3 tbs chopped fresh parsley or more
3 tbs chopped fresh dill or more
1 lemon
Directions:
Put the mussels in a sauce pan with 1 tbs of oil. Add wine, set over high heat, cover and steam for about 3 mins. Shaking pan occasionally until the mussels have opened.
Discard the mussels that remain closed. Let cool in the saucepan.
Strain the cooking liquid and set it aside until required.
Heat the remaining oil in a large deep frying pan. Add shallots, then garlic. Saute' for about 1 mins or until it's translucent.
Add salmon and cook for 2 mins or until it's cooked through. 
Remove cooked salmon and set aside. Keep the shallots, garlic, oil in the pan.
Boil water to cook pasta. Salt the water. Cook as stated in the packaging. Drain.
Pour the reserved mussel liquid into frying pan and bring it to a boil. Lower heat and season with salt and pepper. Return the salmon to the pan. Heat for a few seconds then stir in pasta.
Add parsley, dill, and squeeze lemon juice over. Toss well.
Correct seasonings.
Saute' shallots and garlic
Add the fish - I used salmon for the fish but any firm fish will work
Toss well with fresh herbs
Bon Appetite!

Spaghetti Pumpkin Sauce Filed under: Noodles , pasta by: Tanantha P.

Where did my motivation go?
Hmm...not sure how to answer that.
Recently, I've been a slacker with cooking and other things. I've been too lazy to cook. Is that really bad? I'm not bored of cooking but I'm just not in the mood. I also have a few things (unrelated to cooking) that I have to figure out and think about but the laziness pushes me away from doing that too. Have you ever felt like doing nothing? Where did my motivation to do things go?
It took me more effort just to make the marinade for the fish last night. Why didn't I do it the next day or the day after that, you ask? Well, I was "planing" to cook miso salmon on Monday so I bought fish from the market on Monday. However, I procrastinated on the task until Tuesday.  If I didn't do it last night the fish would go bad. So, I did. At least it's a good start right?
Sigh.
Thanks for all the comments from the last post - The best pizza dough! As you know Denise 's secret is bread obsession . She left me a comment with interesting information and I'd like to share. Denise said cold rise dough has a special flavor compared to normal rise dough.. If Denise who is an expert on making bread said so, the dough recipe is worth bookmarking! This information is new to me and I'm glad to know. Thanks Denise!
I apologize if this pumpkin sauce is too late past Fall.  I'm not going to lie, this dish was made a few months back and hasn't gotten a chance to shine on this blog. I also made penne with the same pumpkin sauce for the New Year's Eve party I hosted. I used fresh homemade pumpkin puree. If you don't have it or are lazy, don't worry at all. Canned pure pumpkin puree works just fine.
Fingers are crossed that my motivation will come back soon (muah!)

The Best Pizza Dough Ever! Filed under: Bread by: Tanantha P.
1.19.11
Before everyone gets tired of my New Year's Feast, I'd better change to something new. Yes, it's new on I Just Love My Apron but not new on the blogosphere. It's pizza time.
Pizza and I are not real buddies. I get tired of it easily and have enough of it after a few days. Unlike Keith, my husband. He can't get enough of it and it becomes an easy-way-out dish for him. When I'm not in a mood to cook (we all have that moment right?), he will do a happy dance if I suggest we go for  pizza.
However, once one of my good friends, Tai, introduced me to a Thai version of pizza.  After that, I have a new perspective of it. Pizza can get S assy! Yes sassy- at least in my opinion. She put basil pork and tom yum chicken for the toppings. It was bomb at the party. Now I only need to find a great pizza dough recipe for an all-homemade version. I've been postponing looking for, and experimenting with, a good recipe until other friends nagged me about it. 
To show how passionate I had become for making pizza, I ordered a brand new cast iron pizza pan. Now you think, "she's serious" right? No, not at all. It was sitting in the kitchen and got dusty after it arrived. Well, the time had come. I found one great recipe. It's easy, simple, and worth the try. Since then, I usually have the dough on hand and freeze it till I need it. The recipe is from the 101 Cookbooks ( www.101cookbooks.com ). It's claimed to be the best pizza dough ever - which I quite agree with. In the blog post, it stated that it came from the Bread Baker's Apprentice Cookbook by Peter Reinhart
One thing I noticed from the recipe is that it uses cold water with instant dry yeast. It's quite interesting since most of the bread recipes call for luke warm water with dry yeast. However, it will yield the best result if you leave it to "ferment" in the fridge overnight. I even used to leave it 2 nights and it tasted great. You just let the ingredients and the magic of yeast do the work and work themselves out. How easy is that?
I will post a Thai topping in the future but for now please enjoy the dough!
Tomato, Basil, Turkey sun dried tomato sausage, Mozerella cheese

Tweaked slightly on directions
Yield: Six- 6 oz pizza crust. I divided into 2 balls for 14"-15" pan.
Note: For a thin crust, you can divide it to 3 balls for 14" pan.
Ingredients:
4 1/2 cups (20.25 ounces)  unbleached high-gluten, bread, or all-purpose flour, chilled. (I always use bread flour)
1 3/4 (.44 ounce) teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) instant yeast. (I use 1 package dry instant yeast.)
1/4 cup (2 ounces) olive oil
1 3/4 cups  (14 ounces)  water, ice cold (40°F)
Semolina flour OR cornmeal for dusting
Flour for dusting
Rolling pin
Zip lock bags
Baking sheet
Directions:
Combine flour, salt, and yeast in a bowl ready for an electric mixer. Stir in oil and cold water. At low speed with the dough hook, mix the flour until it is all absorbed. Switch to medium speed and mix for 5-7 mins. The dough will become smooth, sticky, and elastic. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl.
If the dough is too wet and doesn't come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in some more flour.
If you are mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands or the metal spoon into cold water and knead it.
Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the lightly floured space. I use a different process from the original recipe. It works fine for me. At a prepared space, I knead it a few times. I cut the dough into 3 equal pieces or larger if you have a bigger pizza pan. Sprinkle flour over the dough.
Prepare freezer plastic zip lock. Add 1 tbs olive oil and swirl it to coat. 
Put the dough in the zip lock. Place it on the baking tray and refrigerate over night. You can freeze it for up to 3 months according to Peter. Transfer them to thaw in the fridge a day before baking.
When you are ready to make a pizza, take the dough outside the fridge about 30 mins before baking.
Preheat oven to 500 F.
Dust the counter with flour and remove the dough from the bag. Use a pin roll to roll it out flat and to your desired thickness. After rolling, I spin the dough by hand to expand it. 
Generously sprinkle yellow cornmeal on a prepared cast iron pizza pan.
Place the stretched dough on the pan.
Begin to put on your toppings. On this post I used homemade pesto, Monterrey jack and mozzarella cheese, caramelized onions, and Italian cooked sausage. I prefer to have my meat cooked before topping it.
Bake for 12-15 mins.
Pesto, Cameralized onions, Cheeses, and Italaian sausage
Before I leave the post, I participated in Nancy @ Spicie Foodie YBR for January. I encourage you all to check it out and join the fun!

Mini Shrimp Cups Filed under: Appetizers , Featured , seafood by: Tanantha P.
1.11.11
 
My body is aching from snowboarding this past weekend. It was my first run of 2011! The pain was worth it. I need to condition by going more often :).  I realized how badly out of shape I was; or maybe I must be old! It was snowing pretty much all day and the visibility wasn't that great. Surprisingly, there were a lot of people that day. Aside from snowboarding, we might have a snow storm today or tomorrow in Seattle. Yikes! 
How's 2011 treating you so far?
Back to the food, these mini cups are elegant but surprisingly easy to make. They are so good that I made them twice - first batch for the Christmas Party with the in-laws and the second for the New Year's Eve party that I hosted. They are crowd pleasers; I can guarantee you that. The bite size is adorable and makes them go fast!
As mentioned in the last post, I also made Rudolph red nosed cupcakes from Lisa @ Korean American Mommy ,  upside down pear green tea cake from Patty @ Patty's Food  that I tweaked a little bit, and pretzel Hershey from Roxan @ Kitchen Meditation .
As far as the cupcakes (recipe's here ), my friends loved them. They are so cute. I also boxed them as a gift for friends who couldn't make it to the party. I added a little vegetable shortening to thicken the frosting. Somehow my frosting was runny. I might have accidentally added too much powdered sugar-oops.
Patty asked me how I liked the cake. I tweaked it to a green tea cake, so I cut out chocolate and cocoa powder and added 1 full tsp of matcha green tea powder. It was good, especially eating it with a cup of hot tea. Next time, I will have to cut out the caramel part since it was too sweet for my taste buds (recipe is here ). I didn't use a cast iron pan but used a cake pan instead. It worked fine.
Roxan's pretzels are super easy and adorable! I didn't have Hershey's so I used what I had on hand - Reeses cups.
Thanks for the awesome recipes you guys!
Other than that, I made the beverage that I had submitted to Denise's and Lazaro's Cocktail Contest . This time I used pomegranate and cranberry juice. Over all the party was a success. Everyone was happy and full. Celebrating with good company and good food was a great way to start year 2011!
Pomegranate Cranberry, Lychee, and Ginger Ale drink.  Half had gone already!
Dinner is ready!
Happy 2011.
Mini Shrimp Cups
Tweak slightly from Cooking Light, Dec issue
Yield: 37 cups
Ingredients:
1 tbs water
1 tbs honey
2 tsp canola or vegetable oil
1 package gyoza skins (about 30-40 skins depending on the brand)
1 cup finely chopped celery
1 cup chopped seeded tomato
1/2 cup light mayonnaise or more if needed
1/4 cup chopped fresh chives
1 tsp minced seeded jalapeno pepper (I used 3 tbs!)
1 tsp lime zest
3 tbs lime juice
1 tbs Worcestershire sauce
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 lb cooked peeled deveined shimps, chopped
Brush
Mini muffin tray
Directions:
If you'd like to make it ahead of time so that you won't have to be too busy on the day of, you can chop all the herbs and vegetables in a separate containers. The mayo mixture in another container. On the day of, bake the gyoza skins, mix the mixture and everything else together. Fill the cups before serving.
I used cooked shrimp instead of crab meat but you can change to any kind of seafood you like.
Preheat oven to 350 F. The recipe calls for 375 F but I find it's too hot and sort of burns the gyoza skins. I decrease the temperature and increase time.
Mix mayonnaise, lime juice, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper.
Mix celeray, tomato, chives, jalapeno, zest, and shimps in another bowl.
Mix the mayonnaise mixture into shrimp mixture; refrigerate.
Prepare the gyoza skin. Combine water, honey, and oil in a small bowl.
Brush gyoza skin one at a time with the water mixture on both side.
Place it on a mini muffin tray; pressing it firmly into base of cups.
Repeat it until you fill the tray.
Bake at 350 F for 15 mins or until golden brown. When it's close to 15 mins, check the cups if they are not burn and adjust the time accordingly.
Cool in pans on a wire rack. Carefully remove cups from pans.
Fill each up with the shrimp mixture and serve.

You will have some crispy pork belly left over. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
Ingredients: For the crispy pork belly: 1/2 meaty pork belly, up to 5 lb., fat trimmed to 1/4 inch on skin side
3 garlic cloves, minced
2 tsp. pink salt
1/4 cup plus 1 Tbs. kosher salt
1 Tbs. plus 2 tsp. firmly packed light brown sugar
5 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. coarsely ground peppercorns
1 piece long pepper
1 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. juniper berries
5 bay leaves
3 1/2 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg
6 fresh thyme sprigs
 
For the soup: 1/2 cup diced pancetta (1/4-inch dice)
1/2 yellow onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice
2 celery stalks, cut into 1/4-inch dice
2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch dice
2 cups blanched and roasted chestnuts, plus chopped chestnuts for garnish
4 cups chicken stock
1 bouquet garni tied with twine
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
2 Tbs. unsalted butter
1/2 large shallot, finely chopped
4 oz. wild mushrooms, such as chanterelle, black trumpet or porcini, roughly chopped if large
1/2 tsp. fresh thyme leaves
Celery leaves for garnish
Directions: To prepare the crispy pork belly, trim the pork so it is squared off and the edges are neat. Place on a baking sheet.
In a blender, combine the garlic, pink salt, kosher salt, brown sugar, peppercorns, long pepper, juniper berries, bay leaves, nutmeg and thyme. Blend to a medium-coarse grind. Transfer the curing salt to a bowl.
Rub a generous amount of the curing salt on the pork belly, coating all sides and shaking off the excess. (This recipe makes enough curing salt to coat up to 5 lb. of pork belly; use less curing salt if your piece of pork is smaller.) Place the pork into a vacuum-sealable bag. Using a vacuum sealer, vacuum and seal the bag tight according to the manufacturer’s instructions; be sure you have a smooth, airtight seal. Place the bag on a baking sheet and refrigerate for 3 to 5 days.
Prepare a sous vide immersion circulator for use according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Preheat the water to 175°F.
Remove the pork from the bag, rinse well with cold water to remove the curing salt and pat dry with paper towels. Place the pork into a new vacuum-sealable bag. Using a vacuum sealer, vacuum and seal the bag tight. Carefully place the bag into the circulating water and cook for 12 to 14 hours.
Have ready a large bowl of ice water. Remove the bag from the circulating water and place the bag into the ice water for 30 minutes. If not serving the pork belly immediately, place the bag on a baking sheet and refrigerate for up to 5 days. (If the pork belly is refrigerated, place the bag in the sous vide immersion circulator set at 145°F and heat until the pork is warm.)
To make the soup, in a large saucepan over medium heat, cook the pancetta, stirring frequently, until light golden brown and crispy, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the onion, celery and carrots and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are tender and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the chestnuts, stock and bouquet garni and simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Discard the bouquet garni. Transfer the soup to a blender and blend on high speed until smooth. Return the soup to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Set aside and keep warm.
Meanwhile, in a sauté pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until just tender, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly caramelized and tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and stir in the thyme. Set aside and keep warm.
Just before serving, remove the pork belly from the bag and cut into 3-oz. squares. Heat a nonstick sauté pan over medium heat. Place the pork, fattiest side down, in the pan and cook until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes. Turn the pieces over and cook until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Place 1 piece of crispy pork belly in the center of each of 6 wide soup bowls. Ladle about 1 cup of the soup around each piece of pork. Top with a spoonful of the mushrooms and garnish with chopped chestnuts and celery leaves. Serve immediately. Serves 6.

Roasted Pork with Blackberry Balsamic Reduction, and Potato & Beet Filed under: Pork , Sauce by: Tanantha P.
11.16.10
I'm officially 30.
Gosh. I'm old.
(I know some of you would yell at me to shut up - 30 isn't old!)
There are many things come to my life. Come and go. Good and bad. New and old. I don't take things for granted but feel fortunate to meet great people.
When I was young, 30 is old. I now am 30, and I don't feel any difference from being on late twenties yet. My friends said you will at some point.  Kids come to a marriage life equation. I know it's joy and blessing to have kids. However, I don't know if I want them yet. I just feel I should. New ideas of doing and trying things still keep popping in my head. I have to tell myself to stop and think; do it one at a time.
This past few weeks have been very busy for me. We have a new employee at work that I need to train. My boss was in town, technical Problem at my blog. All committed occasions that we have to attend, birthdays (there are so many Scorpios!), traveling, and the new gig. They keep me very busy. I feel like I need a break. A glass of wine before bedtime completes my day. Since the Europe trip, I've realized a glass of wine a day isn't bad and it helps me sleep well! It may help me build up an alcohol tolerance and I won't be a "Red Lobster" at a social function again. With all that said, the lucky part is that I don't have gray hairs yet! Yippee. Hahaha.
I apologize for not being around a blogosphere much. It has been hectic for me recently and I've been so bad at getting back to people.
So, this dish I made a little while back. I didn't write a measurement down so I didn't remember how much I put but it's pretty easy that you don't need a recipe for this. You get the idea of the dish and you will get it. I'm sorry if this post sounds lousy but I don't want to give you wrong measurements!
Before anything else, I'd like to shout out some news.
First , the new piece on the IE has been up for sometime. This piece got an input from two familiar bloggers - Roxan @ Kitchen Meditation , and Lazaro @ Lazaro Cooks . Please check it out here .
Second , Nancy @ Spicie Foodie just launched her cookbook. Please check it out here .
Roasted Pork Ball with Blackberry Balsamic Reduction, and Potato & Beet
Yield: 4
Ingredients:
2 pork balls. I got these balls from a farmer's market.
Salt and pepper
Smoked paprika
Cayenne pepper
Balsamic Vinegar about 1/2  cup
Black Berries about 1/2 cup
Sugar about 2 tbs
Red and Yokon potatoes, cubed into small bites
Beet, peeled and cubed into small bites
Chopped sage about 1 tbs
4 tbs Butter, divided
Olive oil
Directions:
Season pork with salt, pepper, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper on both sides.
Preheat the oven to 400 F.
Heat up a skillet on medium high heat. Add butter and olive oil. Wait until butter is bubbling, sear pork on both sides. Pour hot butter-oil from the pan over the pork. Pop the skillet in the oven and bake for about 40-45 mins or to your desire of doneness, or the thermometer reaches 165.
In a meantime, heat up another skillet and add 2 tbs butter and olive oil. Add potatoes and beets in a skillet. Season with salt, pepper, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, and sage. Cover with a lid and let the stove works the magic. Stir occasionally. It will take about half hour.
Bring a small sauce pan on a stove. Add balsamic vinegar, berries, and sugar. Bring to boil, then reduce heat to simmer. Simmer it until it's reduced by half.
With leftover beet, cut into match sticks. Pan fried them. Set aside.
Brush the balsamic on pork both sides. Slice the pork and drizzle the balsamic over.
Plating:
Place sliced pork and drizzle with berry balsamic. Add potato/beet on the side. Top with fried beet.

Confession time: Honey-garlic Noodles with Shrimp & Greens
The second I panic that I’m running out of ideas for a blog post and rattle my brains to think of a quick, funny tale to tell you lovely readers, up pops a story opportunity that’s often quite hard to resist. Take today, for example. I’ve been driving myself up the wall since I woke up (read: woken up by a starving, wailing Baby Dear!) this morning for content for a post. I knew I wanted to update today at any cost and I had the perfect recipe for this dreadful weather to boot; but nothing I came up with sounded even the least bit interesting. That is of course, until I logged on and checked my emails. There it was - a lovely note from one of you!
I’m often asked by readers, friends, and even family, if I ever get embarrassed putting myself and my life “out there” for everyone else to read. Truth be told, I rarely ever think of my life as something other than juicy material for this lovely ‘ol blog! A day hardly goes by without me beaming and declaring that a certain incident would make a wonderful precedent to a recipe I had planned. I honestly believe my mind works this way for TWO main reasons:
I was painfully shy and the biggest introvert I know as a teen, and was easily embarrassed even when I was complimented on anything I had done well. As an adult, I now know who I am as a person and am confident enough to show my true self more often. I am still a bit of an introvert, but trust me when I say this is a huge improvement of what I once was!
Hubby Dear LOVES , and I use that word strongly - hence the caps and bold font, having a post revolve around him. Even the mere mention of him in a post makes him beam! And since he does play a MAJOR part in my life, it’s hard to not have an anecdote without him.
Talking about this has inspired me to share some of my not-so-embarrassing-to-me things that I do often. So here goes:
I talk to myself ALL THE TIME! And not just a word here and there - I mean I have real conversations with myself, two sided ones even. Which I why I’m rarely ever bored when alone. I am awesome company, if I may say so myself!
Every now and then I imagine myself being a rock star and rock on to my own tunes in the bathroom with a shampoo bottle as my mic!
Even though I grew up and spent the first 16 years of my life in Kuwait, I never tasted Hummus till I moved to Canada when Hubby Dear took me out for Lebanese food on one of our initial dates. I decided to give it a try to make him stop looking at me funny when I told him about it and found it delicious! Growing up, Hummus was a once-a-week show at our dinner table, but I always thought it looked gooey and honestly, how could a mash of beans EVER taste good? I kick myself every time I take a spoonful now for having to miss out on all those years of Hummus heaven.
When I wake up in the middle of the night and Hubby Dear is snoring away to glory, I always whisper “I love you” into his ear - just so he never forgets!
I love to dance. Not at a club or a party like all normal people do - but in all places considered odd; like at the mall, on the street, or in the car. I’m always doing a jig when I’m happy; and I try to be that most of the time.
I sometimes lightly kick Hubby Dear when he snores at night, keeping me up because of it. Then when he wakes up with a jerk, I pretend to be asleep. It almost always works and he goes back to sleep without snoring again!
Although it’s been over five years since I started this blog, I still get overly excited and gush every time I receive a comment.
I must’ve erased at least three more confessions that I wrote before publishing this post. See, I told you I was still a bit introverted!
My, confessions sure make me hungry and I have just the thing for you today. Hubby Dear is away on business, and Baby Dear and his lovely Mama have been cuddled up in front of the fireplace in their jammies all day. One look at the dreary, snowy weather outside, and I knew I needed a big bowl of something warm and comforting! I’ve had a lot of you ask me for this recipe after seeing the pic posted on my header. Try it, and you won’t be sorry!

The Working Cook: Sauteed Spinach with Potatoes
My day started with me jumping out of bed realizing that I would be late for a meeting with one of my freelance clients. The leisure morning beauty regime I had planned for myself earlier (read: filing my nails into shape considered somewhat normal and putting on some nail polish) had to be ditched while I settled for a quick shower. The meeting went well, lasted for a couple of hours over large cups of fabulous coffee and never ending bites of warm buttery croissants, and ended with me bagging a couple of new assignments. That was followed by a mad dash home to vacuum and hide all the piled up papers, books and unmentionables under our bed to make the home look invitingly presentable to some last minute guests. dirty dishes where haphazardly shoved into the dish washer, and a sweet aromatic rosemary candle was lit. Amidst all the hoopla of trying to make my world look slightly more normal than it actually was, thoughts of food were attacking my brain cells.
I usually maintain a well stocked fridge, freezer and pantry - enough to whip up a lavish multi course meal without heading for the nearest grocery shelves. But not today. The expected guests were close friends who’d much rather have a simple home cooked meal than be flattered by a flambe of sorts. And I had to admit, I was almost out of breadth and ready to crash when I finally entered the kitchen. It had to be a meal that was quick to prepare and didn’t require much effort from me and of course, had to look grand. The one thing about me that you might have noticed by now is my obsessive need to make the people I feed feel extra special. Most dishes I settle for while entertaining are often a breeze to pull of, but you’d never guess that by looking at the spread. And that’s exactly how I like it to be!
I put out a pack of cut-up chicken to defrost with a plan of making a quick deliciously simple curry. I threw a few cups of fragrant Basmati rice into a pot of water with some aromatic spices for a Pulao, and started to tear up crisp lettuce for a quick tossed salad. Just as the rice started to emit a faint saffron aroma and the curry bubbled under a low simmer, I realized that I was missing a vegetable side dish. I found a large bunch of spinach sitting in my fridge, right after I spotted the basket of potatoes on my counter, and I knew just what I was going to be serving - the perfect accompaniment for the spread I had intended.

The Joys of Greens: Chilli Tofu with Beans and Bok Choy
Over the years it has dawned on me that I am perhaps more Malay than Indian when it comes to my food choices. Offer me a generous plate of stir-fried Kangkong and I would forgo the pot of Butter Chicken without so much as a second glance. Well, maybe it’s that easy for me since I never liked Butter Chicken anyway. But a plate of Biryani - now you’ve me getting greedy and highly confused on what to pick!
The main difference I find in the way vegetables are usually cooked in India and Malaysia is the amount of time it takes. Indian vegetables are often cooked to the max - entirely absorbed of all the seasonings and completely cooked through. Which would easily explain why I was never a fan of the dreaded Alu Gobi - who likes a cauliflower all mushy and soft? We recently had a BBQ party where I grilled cauliflower florets marinated in yogurt and spices till they were tender, yet still retained a slight crunch; it was to die for! Malaysian vegetables on the other hand, are often lightly stir- fried. The dish results in a burst of flavours and the veggies maintain their rich colour and crispness.
A couple of days ago I found myself at a gem of an Asian grocery store. This tiny place carried all sorts of Asian greens you could imagine, complete with all the hard-to-substitute fixins’ like Kaffir lime leaves, galangal and garlic chives. I had finally found my candyland. Spending the time there feeling, picking, and smelling the vegetables transported me to my childhood days - those where Mom would often dish out quick Malaysian vegetable dishes that I would actually enjoy eating.
I finally got home two hours later laden with two large bags of fresh produce and another one with a treasure trove of Southeast Asian pantry essentials. From Laksa, Thai curry and Tom Yum pastes to the best curry powder blends my pots have ever touched upon, I now find myself fully equipped! Each time I’ve looked into my pantry the past few days, I come out with a wealth of ideas for my next upcoming meals. And receiving this delightful book in the mail a couple of weeks back has only made it worse! I’ve been churning a wonderful array of fusion dinners for us and Hubby Dear’s waistline is having to bear the brunt of it. Let’s just say that it shouldn’t come as a big surprise to him when I hand him a gym membership as his b’day gift!
CHILLI TOFU WITH BEANS & BOK CHOY
Prep time: 10 min | Cooking time: 20 min | Serves: 4 
1 block of firm tofu, cubed
2 large bunches of bok choy, chopped: green and white parts separated
a big handful of green beans, cut into 1-inch lengths
1 medium onion, finely sliced
1 small tomato, finely chopped
1 tbsp tomato paste
1/2 tsp tamarind concentrate
2-3 large garlic cloves, finely chopped
1/2 tsp red chilli powder
1 tsp coriander powder
1/4 tsp turmeric powder
2 tbsp light cooking oil
salt, to taste
Heat about 1 tsp of oil in a deep non-stick wok, and fry cubed tofu till slightly golden all over. Set aside.
Add in remaining oil in the pan and saute garlic and onions till soft and lightly browned. Add in spices and fry for a few seconds.
Throw in chopped tomatoes, season with salt and fry for a few minutes. Add in tomato paste and tamarind extract, and continue to fry, breaking up tomatoes till it starts to dry out and give out oil from the sides.
Add in beans and tofu, and stir fry till beans are cooked but still crisp. Add in bok choy, and stir fry till it starts to wilt. Serve warm.

A never-ending learning process: Fried Egg Sambal
A few days ago I had a wonderful lunch meeting with an editor of a local magazine. Over a slew of emails deciding on what time and day would best suit the both of us, she suggested we meet for Thai food. That’s when I knew I was going to really like her. And the moment she asked for her Tom Yum soup to be extra-spicy, I knew we were going to be best friends! Lunch was delightful, and the conversation we shared over fresh salad rolls, Pad Thai and Fried Bananas with ice cream was simply exceptional. Being the food editor of the magazine, she undoubtedly shared my obsession with all things culinary. We bonded over our favourite childhood snacks (who knew that ketchup on toast with a dash of pepper was not something that only weird ‘ol me enjoyed! I know, I know, it sounds like a hideous combination; but in my defence, I was 14, breaking out in pimples and was going through a phase where anything out of the ordinary was thought to be “in”…), how we usually plan our vacations based on places that are mostly know for their food more than anything else, and our dislike for broccoli! It was going great until she asked me the dreaded question - when and how did I learn to cook?
I can’t even begin to count the amount of times I’ve been faced with that very question. If only I had a penny for each time I was asked, well, I guess I’d have a lot of pennies by now! As far as I can remember, I actually started cooking when I moved out of home for college; the food there sucked, and since I had an inbuilt kitchen in my room, I figured I could at least try and salvage my hunger and save some money in the process. But I wouldn’t be lying if I said that wasn’t really when I learned to cook. My mom didn’t think much of having me and sister learn to cook the real way. Sure, she’d often have us help her at dinner time by setting the table, making the salad, frying puris while she rolled them out splendidly, and of course, doing the dreaded dishes once everyone was fed. There were days during holidays and weekends, when I would spend time talking to her in the kitchen while she prepped meals. In the process I often took note of how she added one ingredient after the other, roasted spices in dry heat to bring out their aroma, and took special care to avoid any extra gravy while layering Biryani . Little did I know that these special sessions we shared would one day be the basis of my career.
Truth be told, I can’t really point an exact time frame in my life when I actually learned to cook. It kind of just happened, maybe it was always there somewhere. In fact, I’m on a constant learning curve. Each day I educate myself with something new - be it how to make the perfect hard-boiled egg without having the shells stick to it, or that soft, delicious naans could actually be made at home in a flash. Without a tandoor. Who knew! What I can tell you honestly though is that the one thing I actually learned to cook was fried egg. My mom decided to teach me so that I could make my own breakfast without her having to leave the laundry halfway to feed me. It wasn’t a fun experience at all. I must’ve had thrown away a couple dozen before I could manage to crack them just right without thrusting my thumb in and breaking the yolk. But it was all for a good cause. How else could I have made myself this delicious Egg Sambal had it not been for that fateful day.
So, now I ask you - when did you learn to cook?
FRIED EGG SAMBAL
Prep time: 10 min | Cooking time: 20 min | Serves: 4 
4 large eggs
1 medium onion, finely sliced
1 large tomato, finely chopped
1 tbsp tomato paste
2-3 large garlic cloves, finely chopped
1/2 tsp red chilli powder
1 tsp coriander powder
1/4 tsp turmeric powder
3 tbsp light cooking oil
salt & pepper, to taste
Heat about 1 tsp of oil in a non-stick pan (Use one large enough to cook the entire dish, since it makes it much easier to clean up. Personally I prefer using a wok to get perfectly round fried eggs.), and fry egg one after the other seasoned lightly with salt and pepper, adding in more oil if needed. Set aside.
Add in remaining oil in the pan and saute garlic and onions till soft and lightly browned. Add in spices and fry for a few seconds.
Throw in chopped tomatoes, season with salt and fry for a few minutes. Add in tomato paste and continue to fry, breaking up tomatoes till it starts to dry out and give out oil from the sides.
Slowly slide in the fried eggs, and carefully mix them with the tomato mixture to coat, without breaking the egg. Allow to heat through for a few minutes and serve warm.

Simply summer: Mediterranean Kebabs
What is with people who graciously accept your dinner invitation, arrive two hours late without so much as an apology or look of regret on their face, eat merely two bites of the delicious spread you took hours to lay out and declare that they’re just not that hungry! Huh? Wha…?
A few years ago, when I was a newbie in town, I had decided to invite a few people over for a nice dinner so that we could all mingle and get to know each other over mounds of spiked jello shots. The list of invited guests included a few of my colleagues, neighbours, the friendly dude from my dance class and a close friend on mine I’ve known since we were barely in our teens. A weird bunch to bring together no doubt, but I figured that if I ever intended on having a close knit circle of friends to run to over the weekends, then they should at the very least meet each other in person.
I had decided on serving Mexican food. Mainly, because they were such a diverse bunch and I figured that bringing them together over a Taco/Fajita bar laden with fixin’s and over-flowing pitchers of Sangria would definitely lighten everyone’s spirits. And also of course, who doesn’t like Mexican food? I mean, seriously, isn’t it illegal to frown upon it in some parts of the world? Mexico included?
The table was set, plates, glasses and cutlery laid out, and a Mariachi band was serenading away on my second-hand stereo. Slowly, the crowd started to pour in. The music continued to play, folks laughed at each other’s jokes and I couldn’t empty out tortilla chips into the bowls fast enough! It was all going well, until this person made his entrance. He seemed to be in a real bad mood, which made me wonder why he didn’t just call me up and say that he wasn’t able to make it. He sulked in a remote corner all night, nibbling on a handful of chips dipped in about a teaspoon of salsa. Did I mention I actually roasted tomatoes for the first time to make that delicious batch? Needless to say, he hardly even kept a conversation with me - summarizing his answers to my questions in monosyllables. And you’d think he would call me up the next day to apologize, but I’m yet to hear his reasons for his insane behaviour - and it’s been almost seven years now. Not that we’re still in touch though. I somehow find it very hard to maintain my cool with people who show no consideration for others. Which is why I hardly ever cook dinner for them more than once.
When it comes to having friends over, and I mean those people who you really love to spend your time with and not those that you hope to spend some time with - I almost, always, cook whatever they enjoy most. I recently had a close friend over for lunch who is simply smitten by anything Mediterranean! Her love for this eclectic cuisine knows no bounds, and she’s not one to let a good meal pass her by. Since it’s that time of year when I love throw anything on the grill and enjoy a nice lunch outdoors - I wanted to create a cool, calm and simple summer menu, the highlight of which were these deliciously lovely kebabs.
MEDITERRANEAN CHICKEN KEBABS
Prep time: 10 min | Cooking time: 20 min | Makes: 8-10 medium-sized kebabs 
1 lb lean ground chicken
1 medium onion, finely chopped
a handful of fresh parsley, finely chopped
a handful of fresh coriander leaves, finely chopped
2-3 large garlic cloves, finely chopped
1/2 tsp red chilli powder
1 tsp cumin powder
2 tbsp lemon juice
2 tbsp olive oil
1 egg, beaten
2-3 tbsp bread crumbs
salt, to taste
MIX  all the ingredients in a large bowl to incorporate well. Form into kebabs and grill till done on both sides.
RECIPE NOTES: To grill in an indoor oven, heat oven to 375 degrees and grill for 20-25 minutes till done, turning once in between.

Yotam Ottolenghi's tart apple and celeriac salad Wake up your tastebuds after a cold winter's day with this sharply sweet, oniony salad

Yotam Ottolenghi
The Guardian , Saturday 27 November 2010
Yotam Ottolenghi's tart apple and celeriac salad: A breath of fresh air amid the usual winter-warming fare. Photograph: Colin Campbell for the Guardian This salad hits you full on with its sharp sweetness and oniony heat, and it's just what I'd prescribe to shake up tired tastebuds a bit on a drowsy wintry night. Serve it alongside a seasonal stew – squash, say – and you'll get a perfect balance. If you fancy serving it on its own as a light starter, add a handful of chopped walnuts and a few baby leaves. Serves four to six.
120g quinoa
3 tbsp white-wine vinegar
2 tbsp caster sugar
1 tsp salt
1 red onion, peeled and sliced very thinly
60ml rapeseed oil
¼ head celeriac (250g after peeling and slicing)
60ml lemon juice
2-3 granny smith apples (350g after coring and slicing)
2 tsp poppy seeds
1 red chilli, sliced thinly on an angle
15g coriander leaves, roughly chopped
Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil, add the quinoa and simmer for 10 minutes. Drain into a fine sieve, run under cold water and then shake well to remove all the water. Leave to cool down.
While the quinoa is on the go, put the vinegar, sugar and salt in a medium mixing bowl and whisk to dissolve. Add the onion and, using your hands, rub the liquid into it. Add the rapeseed oil, stir and set aside to marinate.
Peel the celeriac, cut it into 3mm thick slices and then cut the slices into long, 3mm-wide strips. Place these at once in a large mixing bowl, along with the lemon juice, and stir well – this will help prevent discoloration. Quarter the apples, remove and discard the cores, and cut the fruit into matchstick-shaped pieces similar to the celeriac. Add the apple to the celeriac bowl and stir well, so it, too, gets a protective coat of lemon juice. (The apples and celeriac can also be cut using a mandolin or a food processor.)
To finish, add the onion and any juices from its bowl to the apple and celeriac mix, then stir in the cooked quinoa, poppy seeds, chilli and coriander. Taste and add extra salt, sugar or vinegar, if you need them – you're aiming for a pungent, sweet and sour flavour.
• Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of Ottolenghi in London.

Yotam Ottolenghi's mushrooms, garlic and shallots with lemon ricotta recipe Tastebuds feeling a little tired after months of winter? Try this warming, hearty mushroom stew topped with a big dollop of flavoured ricotta
Tweet this
Yotam Ottolenghi
The Guardian , Saturday 5 February 2011
Yotam Ottolenghi's mushrooms, garlic and shallots with lemon ricotta: A whole heap of flavour on a single plate. Photograph: Colin Campbell for the Guardian If you are not put off by peeling lots of shallots and garlic cloves, you're in for a winter treat with this hearty, oniony mushroom stew topped with ricotta. You don't need much more, though a chunk of sourdough would not go amiss. To help with the peeling, soak the shallots and garlic in water for half an hour. Serves four.
2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to finish
60g butter
24 baby shallots, peeled
24 garlic cloves, peeled
2 sprigs of thyme
2 cinnamon sticks
200g portobello mushrooms, quartered
250g chestnut mushrooms, quartered
100g buna-shimeji or wild mushrooms
Good pinch of chilli flakes
200ml vegetable stock
1¼ tsp salt
¼ tsp coarse ground black pepper
100ml Pernod
5g tarragon leaves, chopped
10g parsley leaves, chopped
10g mint leaves, chopped
250g ricotta
Zest of 1 lemon
Heat the olive oil and two-thirds of the butter in a large pan and gently sauté the shallots, garlic cloves, thyme and cinnamon for about five minutes, until the onions begin to soften. Add the portobello and chestnut mushrooms, stir well so the mushrooms pick up the oil, and cook for a couple of minutes on a medium-high heat. Add the buna-shimeji and chilli flakes, and cook for a further minute.
Pour in the vegetable stock and simmer over a high heat for eight to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has almost disappeared, and the shallots and garlic are cooked through. Season, then pour in the Pernod. Cook for a minute or two to allow the alcohol to evaporate, then stir through the remaining butter and all the chopped herbs.
Mix the ricotta with the lemon zest in a small bowl. Divide the warm mushrooms between four plates and top each serving with a quarter of the ricotta mixture. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil.

Yotam Ottolenghi's herb soup recipe Herbs are too often the side show, a garnish for the main event. It's time to put them centre stage

Yotam Ottolenghi
The Guardian , Saturday 22 January 2011
Yotam Ottolenghi's herb soup: Soft herbs don't always have to be treated a garnish – whole bunches of the stuff go into this winning soup. Photograph: Colin Campbell for the Guardian Once upon a time, you could hardly buy herbs in this country. Then, with the help of chefs and other enthusiasts, they began to appear in our shops and markets. These days, of course, you can get dozens of varieties, but even so, I think people here are too careful with herbs, seeing them only as a garnish and never as ingredients worthy of taking centre stage. This is evident by the measly size of the packets you get in supermarkets. Herbs deserve to be used much more liberally. So head for a greengrocer who sells them in big bundles (they're much cheaper that way, too). Serves six.
5 tbsp olive oil
2 medium onions, peeled and roughly chopped
2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
2 tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp grated nutmeg
1 tbsp dried mint
500g baby spinach
25g parsley (whole, leaves and stalks)
25g coriander (whole, leaves and stalks)
1200ml vegetable stock
200g Greek yoghurt
10g fresh coriander leaves, chopped
10g fresh mint leaves, chopped
5g fresh parsley leaves, chopped
200g feta
Salt and black pepper
Heat two tablespoons of the olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the onion and garlic, and sauté for around five minutes, or until translucent and soft. Stir in the turmeric and nutmeg, fry for a couple of minutes, then add the dried mint, spinach, the whole parsley and coriander leaves and stalks, and stock. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Season, then blitz the soup with a liquidiser or stick blender until smooth.
When you're ready to serve, reheat the soup just to boiling point and pour the yoghurt into a bowl. Whisk a ladleful of hot soup into the yoghurt, stirring constantly, and repeat with a couple more ladles of hot soup, then tip the yoghurt mix into the soup and whisk in. Stir through the chopped herbs and crumble in the feta, reserving some leaves and cheese to garnish. Adjust the seasoning to taste.
Pour into soup bowls, sprinkle over the herbs and feta, and finish with a generous drizzle of olive oil.
• Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of Ottolenghi in London.

Yotam Ottolenghi
The Guardian , Saturday 29 January 2011
Yotam Ottolenghi's braised leeks with goat's curd: Give leeks a chance. Photograph: Colin Campbell for the Guardian I've done it before, and I am doing it again – putting leeks centre stage. Leeks are normally given the job of flavouring other things, such as stocks and soups, but I find their creaminess and sweet, oniony flavour very satisfying. (They also go well with sharp sauces and are brilliant fried .) This makes an elegant starter. Use long, thin leeks, if you can; if you can get only big brutes, just halve the quantity given here. Serves four.
8 long, thin leeks
2 bay leaves
2 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced
200ml dry white wine
3 tbsp olive oil
250ml water
Salt and black pepper
½ small red onion, peeled and finely chopped
20g currants
1 tbsp cider vinegar
2½ tsp sugar
3 tbsp sunflower oil
100g goat's curd (or a creamy goat's cheese)
1 tbsp picked chervil leaves
First prepare the leeks. Discard the green part, then cut each leek widthways into two, each about 10cm long, and wash. Lay the leeks in a large, shallow pan, add the bay leaves and garlic, and pour in the wine, olive oil and water, so the leeks are half-covered in liquid. Season, then simmer gently for anywhere between 30 minutes and an hour, turning the leeks a few times during cooking, until a knife can be inserted through the middle without any resistance.
Once tender, use a slotted spoon to transfer the leeks to a plate and set aside. Strain the liquid into a small pan and reduce over a high heat until you are left with two tablespoons of sauce. Remove from the heat, add the onion, currants, vinegar and sugar, and season. Set aside so the onion and currants soften in the residual heat while you finish off the leeks.
Heat the sunflower oil in a large frying pan and fry the leek pieces for a couple of minutes a side, until lightly golden. Place on a plate and leave to cool to room temperature.
To serve, divide the leeks between four plates. Top with small chunks of goat's curd, followed by the onion and currant dressing, and finish with a scattering of chervil.

Reviews for Turkey Poblano Chili
5 out of 5
1 total review(s)
Some specialty stores sell chili powders made from specific chili varieties such as ancho or chipotle. Experiment with different powders to find one that you prefer. When seasoning with the more common chili powder, a rich blend of dried red chilies and spices, use sparingly as the heat level may vary.
Ingredients: 2 Tbs. olive oil
2 poblano chilies, seeded and chopped
1 large yellow onion, chopped
2 lb. ground turkey
4 garlic cloves, minced
4 Tbs. chili powder
Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
1 can (14 1/2 oz.) crushed plum tomatoes
2 cans (each 15 oz.) kidney or pinto beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 cup sour cream
Directions: Brown the vegetables and turkey
In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the chilies and onion and sauté until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the turkey and cook, stirring to break up any clumps, until the meat begins to brown, 7 to 8 minutes.
Finish the chili
Add the garlic and chili powder, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, beans and broth. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, uncovered, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Ladle the chili into bowls, garnish with the sour cream and serve immediately. Serves 4 to 6.

Yotam Ottolenghi's fritter roulette recipe Crunchy corn and squash fritters with an added frisson of danger (well, ish)
Tweet this
Yotam Ottolenghi
The Guardian , Saturday 11 December 2010
Yotam Ottolenghi's fritter roulette: Do you feel lucky? Well, do you? Photograph: Colin Campbell for the Guardian I was considering putting a whole chilli into each fritter, but then realised that some people might think this rather brutal. The compromise, Spanish padron peppers, are mostly innocuous, but once in a while you come across a  really spicy one. This is a fun dish, but if you are risk-averse, just leave out the peppers altogether – the fritters will still be very tasty. Makes eight fritters, to serve four.
3 free-range eggs
120ml coconut milk
75g self-raising flour
30g cornflour
¾ tsp ground cumin
1½ tsp ground coriander
½ tsp ground turmeric
3 tbsp coriander seeds
1¼ tsp salt
½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
225g peeled butternut squash (about a third of a butternut), grated
300g corn kernels (frozen or fresh)
3 spring onions, trimmed  and thinly sliced
15g chopped coriander
½ red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped (or more, to taste)
Sunflower oil, for frying
100g padron peppers
3 limes, cut into wedges
Put the first 10 ingredients in a large mixing bowl and whisk to a homogeneous batter. Add the squash, sweetcorn, spring onions, coriander and chilli, and stir to combine.
Pour enough sunflower oil into a medium frying pan to come 1cm up the sides. Place the pan over a medium-high heat for a few minutes, until the oil is hot. Scoop a heaped tablespoon of batter into the oil and cook for a couple of minutes. Using your hand, carefully push two to three peppers (depending on size) into the surface of the fritter while it is frying and fry for another minute (when eating the fritters, avoid the pepper stalk). Throughout the frying, monitor the temperature of the oil, so the fritter doesn't brown too quickly. Turn over with a fish slice and fry for a further three minutes, until golden-brown all over. Transfer to a plate covered with kitchen towel and keep warm.
Repeat with the remaining batter. Once all the fritters are cooked, serve hot, with lime wedges on the side to squeeze over.
• Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of Ottolenghi in London.
