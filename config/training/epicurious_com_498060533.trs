IN	3 or 4 corn tortillas, preferably homemade
IN	1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
IN	1/4 teaspoon ground ancho chile
IN	2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
IN	1 small shallot lobe, thinly sliced
IN	1 small tomato, chopped (or substitute 1/3 cup canned crushed tomatoes in their juices)
IN	1/3 cup cooked chickpeas, preferably homemade, drained and rinsed
IN	3/4 cup lightly packed spinach leaves, stacked, rolled, and thinly sliced
IN	Kosher or sea salt
IN	Freshly ground black pepper
IN	1/2 avocado, peeled, seeded, and cut into chunks
IN	1 ounce feta cheese, crumbled
IN	1 tablespoon roasted pumpkin seeds (pepitas)
IN	Hot pepper sauce, such as Tabasco
IN	1/2 lime
PR	Warm the tortillas and wrap them in aluminum foil to keep warm.
PR	Pour the oil into a medium skillet over medium heat. When the oil starts to shimmer, add the ground ancho, stir to combine, and cook until it sizzles and becomes very fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the garlic and shallot and cook until the vegetables start to soften and slightly brown, 4 to 6 minutes.
PR	Stir in the tomato and chickpeas and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomato softens and starts to break down. Add the spinach and cook until the spinach wilts, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
PR	Lay the tortillas out on a plate and divide the chickpea-spinach mixture among them. Top with the avocado and feta and sprinkle with the pumpkin seeds. Dash a little Tabasco on each taco, squeeze the lime over them, and eat.
NO	Note: To roast the pumpkin seeds, spread them in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake at 375Â°F for 5 to 7 minutes, until the seeds are very fragrant. Immediately transfer to a plate to stop the cooking and allow the seeds to cool completely.
