OT	This was very good. I used it as a veggie dish for dinner. I made one change - I added a small amount of fresh minced garlic. When I make it again, which I will, I am going to top them with a bread crumb topping. I think that will add a great crunch and texture. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	I used fat free ricotta and also added fresh garlic and sprinkled Italian breadcrumbs on top. I think the flavor was good, but next time I will add more seasonings and maybe some chopped tomatoes. Was this review helpful? [ YES ]

OT	What a great way to eat zucchini! We gobbled this recipe up and I will be making it again. Slightly reduced the amount of salt and put in a bit more dried basil than it called for ... fantastic, thanks for sharing! Was this review helpful? [ YES ]
