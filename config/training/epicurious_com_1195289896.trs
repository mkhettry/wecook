IN	12 ounces good-quality semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate
IN	2/3 cup heavy cream or nondairy whipping cream
IN	2 tablespoons Dutch processed cocoa powder
IN	2 tablespoons confectioner's sugar
IN	3 tablespoons finely chopped unsalted pistachios, almonds, or hazelnuts
PR	Finely chop the chocolate by hand or in a food processor fitted with a metal blade, and place in a medium bowl. Pour the cream into a small heavy saucepan. Bring to a rolling boil over medium heat. Pour the cream over the chocolate. With a wooden spoon, gently stir to melt the chocolate. Dont whisk or stir too strongly or you will incorporate air. Cover. Chill until firm, about 2 hours.
PR	Line a baking sheet with parchment or waxed paper. With a small melon baller or ice-cream scoop, drop mixture by rounded teaspoonfuls onto prepared sheet. Freeze until firm, about 20 minutes.
PR	Place the cocoa, confectioners sugar, and chopped nuts into 3 separate shallow bowls.
PR	Roll 1/3 of the balls into the cocoa mixture, 1/3 into the confectioners sugar, and 1/3 into the chopped nuts. Quickly roll between your palms to form them into a perfect round shape. You may need to re-roll in the nuts or sugar if too much falls off. Return to parchment-lined baking sheet or other parchment-lined container, in a single layer. Cover with plastic and chill until ready to serve. Can be made 10 days ahead; keep refrigerated.
