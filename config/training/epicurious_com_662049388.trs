IN	2 1/2 ounces smoked bacon, rind removed, cut into matchsticks (3/4 cup)
IN	1 head iceberg lettuce, chopped (4 cups)
IN	2 ripe heirloom tomatoes, cored, peeled, seeded, and chopped
IN	1 large ripe avocado, halved, pitted, peeled, and cubed
IN	4 ounces chilled blue cheese (preferably Roquefort), crumbled (1 cup)
IN	4 small spring onions or scallions, white part only, trimmed, peeled, and cut into thin rounds
IN	Yogurt and Lemon Dressing
IN	Coarse, freshly ground black pepper
PR	1. In a large, dry skillet, brown the bacon over moderate heat until crisp and golden, about 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to several layers of paper towels to absorb the fat. Blot the top of the bacon with several layers of paper towels to absorb any additional fat. Set aside.
PR	2. In a large, shallow bowl, combine the bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, cheese, and spring onions. Toss with just enough dressing to lightly and evenly coat the ingredients. Season generously with pepper, and serve.
OT	WINE SUGGESTION: This is a special salad, one that seems to hit the spot with all my guests, so let's open a nice, special bottle of smoky-style Alsatian Riesling from the house of LÃ©on Beyer, Trimbach, or Hugel. Neither you nor your guests will be disappointed.
